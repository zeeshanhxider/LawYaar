# 📝 Text Queries: Summary + PDF (Complete Response)

## 🎯 **IMPROVEMENT**

**Before:** Text queries only got PDF (no summary)  
**After:** Text queries get BOTH summary AND PDF

## ❌ **Old Behavior**

```
User (text): "give me judgements on family law"
    ↓
Bot sends: PDF only 📄
    ↓
User sees: Just a document notification
    ↓
Problem: User has to OPEN PDF to see anything
```

**Issues:**
- ❌ No immediate answer visible
- ❌ User must download and open PDF
- ❌ Poor UX - feels incomplete
- ❌ Doesn't leverage WhatsApp's text interface

  1. 📝 TEXT SUMMARY (readable immediately)
  2. 📄 PDF DOCUMENT (detailed reference)
    ↓
User sees:
  - Summary in chat (can read instantly)
  - PDF attached (for detailed review)
    ↓
Perfect: Immediate answer + detailed backup
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Immediate readable answer
- ✅ Detailed PDF for reference

## 💻 **Implementation**

### **1. Text-Optimized Summary Generation**

```python
# NEW: Create summary specifically for text users
text_summary_prompt = f"""
Create a COMPREHENSIVE TEXT SUMMARY:
- DIRECTLY ANSWERS the user's legal question
- Includes key case names (user can READ these)
- Uses bullet points and formatting
- Professional but conversational
- 300-400 words
- Mentions total cases found
- In {language}

IMPORTANT:
- This is TEXT (not voice), so CAN mention case names
- Be thorough but concise - PDF will follow
- Highlight MOST important findings
- End with note that detailed PDF is attached
"""

text_summary = call_llm(text_summary_prompt)
```

### **2. Response Structure**

```python
# Return BOTH summary and PDF
return {
    "type": "text_with_pdf",
    "text_summary": text_summary,  # To display in chat
    "pdf_path": pdf_path,          # To send as document
    "pdf_message": f"📄 Detailed PDF with {doc_count} cases"
}
```

### **3. Handler Logic**

```python
# In whatsapp_utils.py
if response_type == 'text_with_pdf':
    # Send summary FIRST
    send_message(text_summary)
    
    # Send PDF SECOND
    send_document(pdf_path, caption=pdf_message)
    
    # Cleanup
    os.remove(pdf_path)
```
