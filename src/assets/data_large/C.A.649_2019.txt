[3] Both judgments are in essence identical and the Province is the appellant in all the appeals . The Province is aggrieved by the decisions as in terms thereof s. 7 of the Punjab Finance Act, 2011 (which remained in the field till 2015) (“2011 Act” ) was declared ultra vires the Constitution. The said s ection (which was also amended while in the field), insofar as presently relevant , was as follow s: “7.

[4] Education cess on clubs .-- (1) This section shall have effect notwithstanding anything contained in any other law. (2) In this section — … (b) “club” means an association or organization offering members social amenities, meals or temporary residenc e with minimum initial membership fee of two hundred thousand rupees, and notified as club by the Government …; … (3) Notwithstanding any tax or duty levied under any other law, the Government shall levy cess on clubs at the following rates: - S.

[5] No. Activi ty on which cess is levied Rate of cess 1. Initial membership fee 10% of the initial membership fee 2. Services rendered by the club 10% of the charge for a service rendered. CAs  etc. -:3:- … (4) The cess shall be assessed and recovered in the prescribed manner ….” 2. The respondents, who were of course the petitioners before the learned High Court , had submitted before that Court that the levy was in substance nothing other than the sales tax on services.

[6] It was conten ded that such a tax was already in the field when t he 2011 Act was enacted, being then the Punjab Sales Tax Ordinance, 2000 (“2000 Ordinance”) . The said Ordinance was repealed and replaced by the Punjab Sales Tax on Services Act, 2012 (“2012 Act”), which continues to be in the field. Thus, at all times mat erial for the levy imposed by the aforementioned s. 7 there was a sales tax on services in the Province .

[7] On such basis it was conten ded that the respondents were being subjected to double taxation , which according to them w as impermissible under the Consti tution. This contention was accepted by the learned High Court, which held as follows (emphasis supplied) : “It is evident that while abolishing the education Cess on clubs, it was observed that the Clubs are already paying sales tax at the rate of 60% sin ce July, 2012 under the provision of the Punjab Sales Tax On Services Act, 2012.

[8] Thus, it is sufficient to hold that the Clubs were burdened with double taxation which is not permissible under the law .” The sentence highlighted constitutes the core of the reasoning of the learned High Court. On such basis , the petitions were allowed and it was declared that s. 7 had been ultra vires the Constitution. 3.

[9] Before us the learned Additional Advocate General , ably assisted by the Senior Law Officer , submitted th at the learned High Court had erred materially in coming to the foregoing conclusion. It was submitted that double taxation was not impermissible under the Constitution and that the levy under s. 7, even if in substance a sales tax on services which was th e subject matter of another statue, did not for that reason become unconstitutional or otherwise impermissible and beyond the competence of the Provincial Assembly.

[10] Contending that the respondents came within the sc ope of the charg e, and were accordingly liable, the learned AAG prayed that the impugned judgments be set aside. CAs  etc. -:4:- 4. In reply learned counsel for the respondents supported the decisions and submitted that the correct conclusion had been arrived at.

[11] Reliance was placed, inter alia , (as had been don e before the learned High Court) on entry No.49 of the Federal Legislative List of the Constitution. It was prayed that the present matter s be dismissed. 5. Having heard learned counsel as above and examined the law and the record, we came to the conclusi on that, with respect, the impugned judgments could not be sustained and had to be set aside.

[12] We are unable to agree with the basic proposition that found favor with the learned High Court and, as noted above, form s the core basis on which the matter w as decided , that double taxation is impermissible under the Constitution. That, with respect, is not so. Double taxation is not beyond the scope of the relevant legislature, if in substance the levy in question is otherwise properly within its domain.

[13] The corr ect rule is that there is a very strong presumption against double taxation and a heavy burden is cast on the State to show that it has been resorted to. However, i f the language of the statute is otherwise clear then the levy cannot be declared unconstitu tional on such basis. It is to be noted that the question of double taxation invariably arises (although this does not necessarily always need to be so) within the four corner s of the same statute.

[14] The case usually presented before the Court is that in add ition to the charging section of a fiscal statute the State claims that pursuant to some other section (s) therein, the same subject matter is being taxed again. The objection taken by the taxpayer is that this is double taxation , i.e., the subject matter o f the charging section is being taxed all over again.

[15] It is essentially in this context that the rule aforementioned has been laid down and applied . However, even in this context if the Court comes to the conclusion that the language of the other section i s clear and unambiguously imposes the tax (which term is used here in its broadest sense) then the levy so imposed must be enforced regardless of whether it amounts to double taxation.

[16] Th is, of course , is not the case at hand. Here we have two different st atues, one being the 2000 Ordinance/2012 Act and the other the aforementioned s. 7 of the 2011 Act . The question of double taxation does not therefore arise. The only possible question could be whether the levy imposed by s. 7 was within the legislative CAs  etc. -:5:- competence of the Province.

[17] It is well settled that in determining the constitutionality of a levy it is its substance that will be considered , regardless of the name or label attached to it. Learned counsel for the respondents referred to Entry 49. We are, with respect, unable to see how that entry has any relevance for present purposes.

[18] Clearly, and this was quite correctly accepted by learned counsel , the levy imposed by s. 7 was not on the sale of goods. When learned counsel were qu eried as to what, in su bstance, was the levy imposed by the section if not a sales tax on services, they were, with respect, unable to come up with a satisfactory answer.

[19] In our view the substantive nature of the levy was clearly a sales tax on services. It could well be the cas e that this levy impose d a double financial or commercial burden on the respondents , and for the same transactions they were liable to pay sales tax both under the 2012 Act as well as s. 7. In this economic sense i t may have amount ed to double taxation and, indeed, perhaps that was the sense in which the learned High Court understood the levy to be .

[20] But that is not what is the legal meaning , and nature , of double taxation , with which alone the Court is considered in the facts and circumstances of the presen t case. It is also to be noted that sub - section (1) of s. 7 contained an express non obstante clause, and the charging provision (sub -section (3)) further reinforced this by itself containing another non obstante clause.

[21] These provisions strongly confirm t he legislative intent and serve to negate any conclusion that the levy could be struck down as amounting to double taxation, whether on the legal or the economic or financial planes. Therefore, in our view, the learned High Court, with respect, erred in co ming to the conclusion that s. 7 ought to be struck dow n on the ground that it amounted to double taxation as a matter of law , and was beyond the power conferred by the Constitution.

[22] The judgments being unsustainable have to be set aside. 6. Before conclud ing, we may note that the 2011 Act came into force, as the Finance Act s invariably do, on the 1st of July. However , as is clear from the charging provision it becam e applicable only on such entities as were notified as clubs by the Provincial Government .

[23] It is an accepted position that the relevant notification was issued on 09.03.2012. Therefore, the liability of the respondents to pay the levy only arose from that date and CAs  etc. -:6:- continued up to 30 .06.2015 (when s. 7 was omitted by the Finance Act of that year) . Since the matter is somewhat old and it is only now that it has been definitively established that the respondents were liable under the section , we direct that any amount s that remain unpaid or recoverable from the m shall be paid in four equal quarterly installments, the first payment being due and payable on 30.06.2022. 7.

[24] In view of the foregoing, at the conclusion of the hearing it was announced that the appeals stood allowed, with the impugned judgments being set aside . Judge Judge Judge Islamabad, the 28th February, 2022 Naveed /* Approved For Reporting.
