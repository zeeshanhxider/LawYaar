[1] judgment dated 10.03.2015 passed by the Peshawar High Court Bannu Bench in Crl. Appeal No.29-B of 2013 ) Islam Sharif …Petitioner (s) Versus The State …Res pondent (s) For the Petitioner (s): Mr. Rizwan Ejaz, ASC For the State : Malik Akhtar, A.A.G. KPK Date of hearing: 03.03.2020. JUDGMENT Qazi Muhammad Amin Ahmed , J.- Islam Sharif, petitioner, indicted for committing Qatl-i-Amd of Dr.

[2] Sahib Jan on 3.9.1991 within the precincts of Police Station Ghoriwala, District Bannu was returned a guilty verdict by a learned Addl. Sessions Judge vide judgment 11.2.2013; convicted un der clause (b) of Section 302 of the Pakistan Penal Code, 1860, he was sentenced to imprisonment for life, upheld by a learned Judge in Chamber of Peshawar High Court vide impugned judgment dated 10.3.2015 , vires whereof are being assailed on a variety of grounds that include improbability of presence of witnesses , issue of identification owing to darkness, absence of casing as well as prosecution ’s failure to recover the weapon. 2.

[3] Prosecution case is structured upon ocular account furnished by deceased sons, namely, Saifullah (PW -4) and Inayatullah (PW -5); according to them, on the fateful morning , shortly before Fajjar prayer, they followed the deceased , en route to a nearby mosque ; when the petitioner confronted the deceased with a fire shot.

[4] Dispute over a house is cited motive for the crime . Jail Petition No. 430 of 2015 2 Autopsy conducted at 8:00 a.m. confirmed solitary fire shot as being the cause of death . The petitioner stayed away from law and was finally apprehended as late as on 24.3.2011 to face trial. 3. Heard. Record perused. 4.

[5] It is in evidence that the petitioner as well as the deceased lived in the same rural neighbourhood ; dispute over the house has been raging since the year 1982 and, thus, it can be safely assumed that the both sides were well acquainted with each other . Fajjar prayer is held shortly before dawn with the recession of darkness ; in such a situation, identification of the culprit by the witnesses , proceeding in clos e proximity with the deceased , in the month of September , particularly in view of long standing acquaintance , cannot be viewed with suspicion; their joint departure with the deceased to offer prayer in the nearby mosque is a usual pursuit, particularly in a rural neighbourhood of Khyber Pakhtun Khaw.

[6] There appears no earthly reason for the witnesses to swap the assassin of their elderly father with an innocent . Totality of circumstances that, inter-alia, includes an ong oing dispute as well as petitioner ’s longstanding absconsion spreading over almost two decades unmistakably suggest petitioner ’s culpability; there was no occasion for recovery of the weapon in the wake of petitioner’ s long disappearance from the scene.

[7] Both the witnesses , inmates of the same premises, despite lapse of considerable time furnished graphic details of the occurrence , in a manner found by us consistent, straightforward and confidence inspiring ; cross -examination remained inconsequential. Find ing of guilt, concurred by both the courts below is not open to any legitimate exception.

[8] Petition fails. Leave declined. Judge Judge Islamabad , the 3rd March , 2020 Not approved for reporting Azmat /-
