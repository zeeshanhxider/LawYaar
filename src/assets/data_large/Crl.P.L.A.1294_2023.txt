[2] This criminal petition for leave to appeal has been filed against the order dated 12 October 2023 wherein it is recorded that the petitioner’s counsel did not press this petition in order to approach ‘ august ’ Supreme Court of Pakistan.

If a fresh ground had become available to the petitioner prior to the passing of the impugned order then counsel should not have withdrawn the petition , but insisted that the petition be decided on merits .

At this stage learned counsel states he does not press this petition as he wants to avail of an alternate remedy.

We also observe the repeated use of word ‘august’ used before the Supreme Court of Pakistan or it is used as an alternative August Court . This Court is mentioned in the Constitution as the Supreme Court of Pakistan , without any prefix or adjective , and we should all endeavour to abide by the description s mentioned in the Constitution.
