[2] For the Complainant : Mr. Zulfiqar Khalid Maluka, ASC Date of hearing: 24.08.2020. ORDER Qazi Muhammad Amin Ahmed , J.- Petitioners are blamed to have caused injuries , after forming an unlawful assembly, to the witnesses inside the safety of complainant’s home located within the remit of Police Station Miranpur District Vehari ; they agitated a cross version that failed with the police .

[3] A learned Additional Sessions Judge at Mailsi primarily declined their request for bail in anticipation to their arrest on the ground that after the assault they repeated violence for which two different First Information Reports dated 05.02.2020 and 09.02.2020 were lodged during the period they were on ad interim bail s; they did not display a better conduct in the High Court either ; they were admitted to ad interim pre-arrest bail by a learned Judge -in-Chamber on 20.3.2020 on the condition of bonds , however, till the time of final hearing that took p lace as late as on 4.6.2020 they were found to have failed to file the bond s as directed by the Court. 2.

[4] Heard. Criminal Petition No.630 of 2020 2 3. It is a run of the mill criminal case wherein two sides confronted each other over an incident of eve -teasing ; it graduated into a situa tion wherein both sides appe ared to have sustained injuries and despite considerable lapse of time in the face of petitioners’ failure in their cross -version, they remained away from law by invoking a remedy which has judicially been devised to protect the innocent from the rigors of abuse of process of law initiated for purposes other tha n noble ; the protection cannot be granted to stifle the investigative process and as such petitioners’ case does not fall in that category, particula rly in view of their conduct before the Courts below, found by us as far from being enviable.

[5] Petition fails. Leave declined. Judge Judge Islamabad, the 24th August, 2020 Not approved for reporting Azmat/ -
