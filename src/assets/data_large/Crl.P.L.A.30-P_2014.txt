KP, Peshawar …Petitioner Versus Amanat Khan, etc. ..Respondent For the Petitioner(s) : Mr. Muhammad Nisar , Addl. A.G. KP For the Respondent (s): N.R. Date of hearing: 06.7.2021 ORDER Qazi M uhammad Amin Ahmed , J-.

[2] In broad daylight , Javed Ali Shah, 40, was shot dead within the precincts of Police Station Lahore District Swabi ; First Information Report was lodged by his uncle Syed Sardar Shah (PW-3) wherein he blamed the respondent , a previous convict, as the sole culprit , in the backdrop of a previous altercation.

[3] Autopsy conducted at 1: 05 p.m. confirmed four entry wounds with corresponding exits. Respondent stayed away from the law and was finally spotted in a prison at Takhat Bhai wherefrom he was transposed as an accused in the present case ; pursuant to a disclosure , he led to the recovery of a .30 caliber pistol , however, incompatible with the casings secured from the spot.

[4] A learned Additional Sessions Judge vide judgment dated 31.01.2013 convicted him under clause (b) of Section 302 of the Pakistan Penal Code, 1860 with the sentence of death alongside a direction to pay compensation, overturned by a Division Bench of Peshawar High Court Peshawar vide impugned judgment dated 20.02.2014 , vires whereof, are being assailed on the ground s that in the face of overwhelming evidence furnished by natural witnesses having no axe to grind , there was no occasion for the High Court to acquit the respondent from the charge , squarely structured on ‘proof beyond doubt ’.

[5] It is next argued that the impugned view of the High Court , seemingly based upon various circumstances , considered by it as suspect , mostly relate to peripheral or investigative flaws, with no bearing upon the Cr.P.30-P/2014 2 preponderance of ocular account furnished by the witnesses who had satisfactorily explained their presence at the spot ; they do not seem to have an axe to grind by substituting an innocent with the guilty.

[6] It is lastly argued that in the wake of respondent’s absconsion , a negative foren sic report did not adversely effect the prosecution’s case nor non -mentioning of specific caliber of the weapon could destroy the intrinsic value of the testimony that successfully withstood the test of cross -examination , particularly having regard to the formidable past, hounding the respondent .

[7] Leave is granted to reappraise the entire evidence with a view to secure the ends of justice. Send for the respondent through bailable warrant of arrest in the sum of Rs.200,000/ - with one surety in the like amount , returnable to the Assistant Registrar of this Court at Peshawar, to be executed through Station House Officer, within a fortnight.
