[1] ORDER SH. RIAZ AHMED, CJ. Through this common short order, we propose to dispose of the captioned petitions which were filed under Artic le 184(3) of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, assaili ng insertion of Article 8 AA in the Conduct of General Elections Order 2002 (Chief Executive Order N o. 7 of 2002) whereby it was enacted that a person who had been defeated in the elections of National and Provincial Assemblies held in October 2002, shall be di squalified to contest the electi on for a seat in the Senate.

[2] After hearing learned counsel representing the petitioners in th ese petitions and Mr. Makhdoom Ali Khan, the lear ned Attorney General for Pakistan, and for reasons to be incorporated subsequently through a detaile d order, we hold that Article 8-AA ibid, is discriminatory in nature and as such violative of Article 25 of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan.

[3] We furt her hold that disqualification attributable to defeat in consequence of lawful act of contesti ng election of the Na tional and Provincial Assemblies should have been provided in th e original order itself, being impugned herein, so that, the affected persons should have an opportun ity to avoid to suffer such disqualification.
