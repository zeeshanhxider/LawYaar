[1] judgment dated 23.01.2007 passed by the Peshawar High Court, Peshawar in Criminal Appeal No.632 of 2005 ). State thr . Deputy Attorney General …Appellant(s) VERSUS Abdul Ali …Respondent(s) For the Appellant(s) : Mr.Manzoor Khan Khalil, Additiional Advocate General, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Mr.Ta riq Khan, ASC For the Respondent(s) : Mr.

[2] Noor Alam Khan, ASC Date of Hearing : 29.04.2019 JUDGMENT Abdul Ali, respondent was returned a guilty verdict by learned Judge, Special Court (CNS), Peshawar; he was indicted for being in possession of seven teen kilograms of opium at an FC check post. The learned Peshawar High Court, however, acquitted him from the charge vide impugned judgment dated 23.1.2007, vires whereof are being challenged by the State.

[3] It is argued that there was no occasion for the learned High Court to acquit the respondent in the face of overwhelming evidence, singularly pointed on respondent’s culpability when intercepted with huge quantity of contraband that cannot be conceivably foisted upon him. Forensic evidence confi rming the narcotic character of the contraband his next argument is to seek reversal of the impugned judgment.

[4] Quantity of contraband notwithstanding, view taken by the learned High Court to acquit the respondent is neither artificial nor perverse inasmu ch as discrepancy between the stated Criminal Appeal No.12 -P/2013 2 date of respondent’s arrest and his remission into police custody for registration of a criminal case sans any plausible explanation.

[5] Contradictions in the statements of Mir B adshah Khan, PW -3 and Sabz Ali, PW -4 in the above backdrop cannot be received as trivial and thus it is rightly held that the local police and FC personnel, being out of tune, the charge against the respondent is not free from doubt. Impugned view being a possible rendition warrants no interference.
