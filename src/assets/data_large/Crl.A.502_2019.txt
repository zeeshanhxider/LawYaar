[18] The Appellate Court , vide common judgment dated 11 February 2015 , dismissed Criminal Appeal No.11 -ATA/2010, answered CSR No.10 - ATA/2010 in negative , accept ed Criminal Appeal No.27 -ATA/2010 and while extending the benefit of doubt, acquitted the convict Muhammad Ajmal. Crl. A. No. 502 of 2019 4 7.

[19] The Appellate Court, vide common judgment dated 11 February 2015 , answered CSR No. in negative , maintain ed the convicti on of the convicts Muhammad Sadiq, Hazaray Khan and Muhammad Aslam u/s 302(b) PPC but commuted their death sentence to imprisonment for life with amount of compensation as directed by the Trial Court.

[20] Their conviction and sentence u/s 324 and 452 PPC, as recorded by the Trial Court, were maintained. However, t heir conviction and sentence u/s 7 of the Anti -Terrorism Act, 1997 and u/s 148 PPC w ere set aside . The Appellate Court further ordered that all the sentences shall run concurrently with benefit of section 382 -B Cr.P.C. 8.

[21] The convicts Muhammad Aslam, Muhammad Sadiq and Hazaray Khan challenged their conviction and sentence by filing Jail Petition No. wherein leave to appeal was granted on 30 October 2019 and same was converted to Criminal Appeal N o. . The complainant filed Criminal Petition for Leave to Appeal No.355/L/2015 and 354/L/2015 challenging the acquittal of the accused as well as for enhancement of the sentence of the convicts wherein leave to appeal was granted vide order dated 30 October 2019 and same were converted into Criminal Appeal No s. and  respectively. 9.

[22] During pendency of the above appeals, co-convict Muhammad Aslam passed away in jail and to his extent Criminal Appeal No. stands abated . 10. After hearing learned counsel for the appellants and learned Additional Prosecutor General , we ha ve perused the available record. According to the case of the prosecution , during investigation a 44 bore rifle with five live bullets were recovered from the appellant Muhammad Sadiq and a Kalashnikov with five live bullets was recovered from the appellant Hazaray Khan but said recoveries have been disbelieved by the Appellate Court due to lack of independent corroboration. 11.

[23] Thirty nine crime empties of Kalashnikov , three crime empties of 12 bore alongwith the firearms , allegedly recovered from the appellants Muhammad Sadiq and Hazaray khan , were not sent to the firearm expert for analysis and in this regard no explanation has been offered by the prosecution at the trial . 12.

[24] The complainant is son of deceased Nazar Muhammad and is having blood relations with all the deceased and injured. Accordin g to his statement recorded at the trial as PW.18 , in the night of occurrence, he Crl. A. No. 502 of 2019 5 alongw ith all the deceased and injured w ere sleeping in the house while his father Nazar Muhammad was sle eping at the tube well .

[25] Accordin g to PW.18 , in the night of occurrence, they all awoke on hearing sound of motorbikes at 4:30 am. All the eight nominated accused i.e. the appellants and acquitted accused , trespassed into their house and started firing . PW.18 has specifically nominated all the accused with specific firearms in their hands and has attributed specific firearm injuries on specific parts of the bodies of the deceased as well as the injured to all the accused with precision .

[26] Surprisingly, PW.18 did not receive a single firearm injury in the whole occurrence despite indiscriminate firing by the eight nominated accused and despite being in close range , allegedly witnessing the occurrence. 13. According to PW.18 , his father was fired upon by the convict Abdul Ghafoor while sleeping at the tube well.

[27] Admittedly PW.18 was not present at the tube well with deceased Nazar Muhammad. 14. Non-receiving of any firearm injury by PW.18 during the occurrence and his accurate attribution of each injury of the deceased and injured to each accused with specific firearm s casts serious doubt about his presence at the place of occurrence and his plantation as an eye witness of the occurrence due to previous enmity with the nominated accused cannot be ruled out of consideration particularly when his testimony is lacking independent corroboration in material aspects. 15.

[28] Mukhtiar Ahmed (stated to be an eye wi tness of the occurrence) and the injured Wazir Ahmed, Kaniza n Mai and Sughra Mai have not been produced at the trial due to which presumption under Article 129 (g) of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 is drawn to the effect that had these witness es been produced at the trial , they would have not supported the prosecution version. 16.

[29] PW.14 Muhammad Shahid made statement that he had received firearm injuries on his right knee . Despite accurately mentioning about the firearm injuries of the deceased and th e injured with specific attribution to all the nominated accused , he has not attributed his firearm injuries to any accused. The statements of PW.14, injured Muhammad Shabbir (PW.16), Rukhsana Mai (PW.17 ) and the complainant (PW.18) are suffering from dishonest improvements and material contradictions rendering their testimony doubtful. 17.

[30] The infirmities in the case of the prosecution and contradictory statements of the prosecution witnesses which are al so suffering from Crl. A. No. 502 of 2019 6 dishonest improvements , have created reasonable doubt in the case of the prosecution . According to the settle d principle s of law , benefit of reasonable doubt has to be extended in favour of an accused. 18.

[31] On reappraisal of the evidence available on record , it is concluded that the prosecution has failed to prove the charge ag ainst the appellants as well as the acquitted accused beyond reasonable doubt. 19. For the above reasons drawn today, vide our short order of even date, Criminal Ap peal No.  (filed by the convicts Hazaray Khan and Muhammad Sadiq ) has been accepted and the y have been acquitted of the charge while Criminal Appeal No s.  ( challenging the acquittal of the accused ) and Criminal Appeal  (for enhancement of sentence of the convicts) have been dismissed.
