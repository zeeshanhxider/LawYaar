[1] judgment of the Balochistan Service Tribunal, Quetta dated 25.02.2015 passed i n S.A. No. 394 of 2013 ) Chief Secretary, Govt. of Balochistan and others ...….Appellant (s) Versus Masood Ahmed and another ….Respondent(s) For the Appellant (s): Mr. Muhammad Ali Rakhsahani, Addl. AG Mr. Gohar Yaqoob Yousafzai, ASC For the Respondent (s): Ex.

[2] Parte Date of hearing: 26.07.2023 JUDGMENT Jamal Khan Mandokhail , J.- Respondent No.1 was an officer in BS-20 of the Government of Balochistan and was serving in the Federal Government on deputation w.e.f. 01 .01.2001 to 31.12.2013 . The Provincial Se lection Board (the “Board ”) convened a meeting for promotion of officers .

[3] The case of Respondent No.1 for promotion was not considered for the reasons that he was on deputation , did not re-join his parent department , nor submitted his ACRs during the said period . Conse quently , his promot ion was deferred and instead Respondent No.2, who was junior to him, was promoted.

[4] Respondent No.1, fe eling aggrieved, filed an appeal before the Balochistan Service Tribunal ( the “Tribunal” ). The Tribunal agreed with the fi ndings of the competent authority regarding promotion of Respondent No.2, however, in paragraph 10 of the impugned judgment, the Tribu nal held as under: “However, we also direct the department to allow proforma promotion to the appellant.

[5] In view of the above discussio n, we accept the appeal to the extent that the respondent No.2 (Secretary S&GAD) grant 2 Civil Appeal No. 40 -Q of 2018 proforma promotion to the appellan t in BS -21 as personal by creating a post through Finance Department after fulfilment of all the formalities by the appell ant through P rovincial Selection Board.

[6] The appeal is disposed of accordingly with no order as to costs.” 2. Respondent No.1 did not challenge the impugned judgment of the Tribunal, instead it was challenged by the Government of Balochistan throug h its Chief Secreta ry, wherein leave to appeal was granted on 13.12.2018 as under: “2. Learned counsel contends that the post in BPS -21 is a selection grade post; therefore, no such direction could have bee n issued in the ligh t of the judgment r endered by this Cou rt in the case of Government of Pakistan versus Hameed Akhtar Niazi (PLD 2003 Supreme Court 110).

[7] The point noted above does call for examination, therefore, leave to appeal is granted.” 3. Despite service of notice , Respondent No.1 did not appear before this Court , as s uch, he was proceeded against ex parte on 28.02.2020 . 4. Arguments heard and have perused the record. The Government of Balochistan has framed the Balochistan Province Civil Servants Deputation Policy (“ Deputation Policy ”), Para 4(iii) whereof stipulates that “ a deputationist shall not be promoted in absentia in his parent depar tment, if he becomes due during the period of his deputation unless he rejoins. ” As per the Deputation Policy, re-joining the department is a condition precedent for a deputationist for his consideration for promotion by the Board .

[8] Admit tedly, Respondent No.1 was serving in the Federa l Government on deputati on for almost 13 years, c ontrary to the period fixed by the Deputation Policy. In order to consider his case for promotion , he was required to report to his parent department and submit his ACRs , but he failed to do so as required .

[9] Since Respondent No.1 was not entitled to be considered for p romotion , the Board was right in not considering his case. 3 Civil Appeal No. 40 -Q of 2018 5. The Tribunal w hile deciding Respondent No. 1’s ap peal, endorsed the decision of the Government regarding his non - promotion . The said decision of the Tribuna l was not challenged by Respondent No. 1, rather the Government feelin g aggrieved by the above -reproduced paragraph of the impugned judgment filed this appea l.

[10] The only issue in the instant appeal is with regard to the direction of the Tribunal to the Government for creati on of a new post and promoting t he Respondent No.1 against it . Under section 5(1) of the Ser vice Tr ibunal s Act, 1973 (the “Act”), the Tribunal on an appeal of an agg rieved person, is empowered to confirm , set aside, vary, or modi fy the ord er appealed against .1 The power of the Tribunal has been enshrined in the Act; thus, it cannot go beyond what the la w states .

[11] Creat ion of a p ost is a policy decision , based upon the requirement s of a department and involve s economic factors , which is the sole discretion and executive authority to be exercised by the Government alone . The Tribunal cannot assign to itself such executive function , nor can it grant relief not pro vided under t he law.2 It is supposed to apply the law in its true letter and spirit , but through the impugned judgment the Tribunal has entered into the domain of the Executive .

[12] Exercisi ng such power beyond its mandate is a dangerous trend , which must be discouraged . 6. Even otherwise, p romotion of an officer in selection grades is based upon the principle of fitness -cum-seniorit y, which depends upon multiple factors , as per the service rule s based upon the service record of the incumben t.

[13] These factors can on ly be determined by the Board and upon its recommendations, it is the prerogativ e of th e Government to agree or disagree with such recommendations . However, in case of disagreement , reasons must be assigned by the competent autho rity. Consequently , directing the Governm ent to creat e a new post and grant proforma promot ion to Respondent No. 1 amounts to exercise of power in excess of the Tribunal ’s authority , which is without juris diction . 1 PLD 2003 SC 724 2 2023 S CMR 803; (2008) 1 SCC 683 4 Civil Appeal No. 40 -Q of 2018 Thus, in view of above, the appeal is allowed.

[14] The impugned judgment of the Tribunal to the extent of the direction s in paragraph 10 is hereby set aside. Judge Judge Quetta , 26.07.2023 K.Anee s/Ammar, LC APPROVED FOR REPORTING
