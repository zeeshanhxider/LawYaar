[1] order s dated 07.09.2022, 12.10.2022, and 27.10.2022 . And thus, denying bail to the petitioner in FIR No. 681 , when the two cases prima facie are cross -cases , would not be appropriate . 5. It would also be pertinent to note that a counter version put forth by a party which is contrary to the one already rendered by a complainant in an FIR, if it fulfils the essentials of a cross -case as to the time and place of the commission of an offence ; would constitute a cross - case, and it cannot be declared to be otherwise solely on the ground that the party claiming its version to be a cross -case did not allege self - defence in the counter version of the events leading to the commission of the o ffence and recording of the FIR in which he is nominated as an accused. 6.

State 1997 SCMR 251. 5 Hamza Ali Hamza v. State 2010 SCM R 1219; Muhammad Ashiq v. State 2013 YLR 1133.
