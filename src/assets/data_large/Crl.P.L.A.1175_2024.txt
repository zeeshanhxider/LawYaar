[4] Crl. P. No. 1175 of 202 4 2 3. While opposing the grant of post -arrest bail to the petitioner, learned Special Prosecutor, Punjab stated that subsequent to th e registration of the FIR on 12th May 2023, on the basis of tweets/ audio/video clips on social media through Whattsapp, Facebook and T witter, the petitioner was implicated by the complainant in supplementary statement dated 10th June 2023; sufficient incriminating material is available on record to prima facie connect the petitioner for hatching the criminal conspiracy for commission of non -bailable offences; that delay in conclusion of trial cannot be wholly attributed to the prosecution as on most of the dates of hearing , adjournment was sought by the learned defence counsel. 4.

[5] After hearing learned counsel for the petitioner as well as the learned Special Prosecutor, Punjab we have perused the available record which transpires that the petitioner was not nominated in FIR No.  lodged with PS Sarwar Road, District Lahore on 12th May 2023 for the occurrence of 9th May 2023. The petitioner was implicated by the complainant in his supplementary statement dated 10th June 2023 on the basis of tweets/ audio/video clips on social media.

[6] The admissibility , relevancy and evidentiary value of the supplementary statement of the complainant as well as the alleged tweets/ audio/video clips on social media are yet to be determined at the trial which has not yet concluded despite lapse of almost two years. According to the settled principles of law, bail cannot be withheld as mere punishment. 5.

[7] The petitioner has been arrested for the allegation of hatching the criminal conspiracy for the occurrence of 9th May 2023 . The allegation is yet to be proved by the prosecution at the trial. The prosecution has yet to explain the delay of three days in lodging FIR as well as delay of about one month for making the supplementary statement by the complainant. 6.

[8] On the basis of tentative assessment of the material so far available on record, the case against the petitioner falls within the ambit of further inquiry. The petitioner is also entitled for grant of bail on the rule of consistency as co -accused Imtiaz Mehmood has already been granted bail by this Court for the same allegation in the same FIR vide order dated 17th April 2025. 7.

[9] For the above reasons, while granting leave, the petition is converted into appeal and same is accepted. The petitioner is granted post -arrest bail under sections 7 of the Act , 324, 395, 436, 427, 290, 291, 148, 149, 337-L(2), 34, 109, 120 -D, 121, 121 -A, 131, 146, 153, 153 -A, 153 -B, 505 Crl. P.
