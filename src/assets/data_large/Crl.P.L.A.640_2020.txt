A previous brawl is cited as motive for the crim e. 2. Heard. Record perused. 3. Awful magnitude of violence and resultant loss of life notwithstanding, nonetheless, the petitioner though statedly present with other family members outside his home where the deceased had gone to lodge complaint for the previous incident, is not attributed any harm to them, as on prosecution’s own showing, he allegedly instiga ted his father , otherwise authoritatively placed on the parental rung.

[3] Question as to whether , instead of taking deadly initiative himself, he preferred to persuade his father for the misadventure , a role , contrary to the traditions , brings the accusation within the ambit of subsection 2 of section 497 of the Code of Criminal Procedure 1898 and thus, would be best settled after Criminal Petition No.640 of 2020 2 recording of evidence , therefore , he cannot be kept behind the bar s merely as a measure of punishment .
