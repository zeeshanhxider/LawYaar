[1] order of this Court dt. 21.5.2014) AND CRP No.295 of 2014 in Civil Petition No.740 of 2013 (Review against this Court’s order dated 21.5.2014 passed in CP -740 of 2013) Ameer Rehman, etc. … Applicant(s) Versus Ameer Mumtaz, etc. … Respondent(s) For the petitioner(s): Syed Rafaqat Hussain Shah, AOR (in CRP -) On Court’s notice: Dr.

[2] Babar Awan, Sr. ASC (CMA -) For Ameer Mumtaz, etc.: Mr. Sher Muhammad, ASC Mr. M. S. Khattak, AOR Date of hearing: 01.07.2015 ORDER Jawwad S. Khawaja, J. - CMA -: - On 21.5.2014 while deciding CP No.740 of 2013 we had passed an order dismissing the said petition with costs. However, while dismissing the petition, we had also observed as under: - “8.

[3] In the foregoing circumstances, we hold that the title of the private respondents stood established and there is no necessity for reopening the issue of title considering the circumstances which have been narrated above. We have, however, considered the possibility of taking action against the petitioners under para 12 of President’s Order No.12 of 1980, which provides as under: - “Punishment, ---Whoever obstructs any person in enforcing or giving effect to any decision or order made under this Order shall be punishable with rigorous imprisonment for a term which may extend to three years, or with fine, or with both.” 9.

[4] In the alternate, we may also consider initiating proceedings inter alia, under Section 476 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898. We can not allow abuse of process of the Court as it undermines the credibility of the Court. 10. Let notice issue to the petitioners to show cause as to why such action should not be initiated.

[5] Notice shall also issue to the respondents. Mr. Sher Muhammad Khan, learned ASC accepts notice on behalf of the private respondents. The office shall create a separate file and list this matter for hearing after thirty days. The petition stands dismissed with costs.” CMA - in CP - & CRP - in CP - 2 Pursuant to the notice which was issued to Ameer Rehman , Rehm Dad, Muhammad Nawab and Pir Jamal petitioners in CP -, a separate file was created which is before us.

[6] We have heard learned counsel for the aforesaid Ameer Rehman, etc. He has taken us through the order passed by us on 21.5.2014. His main pl ea is that the aforesaid persons namely Ameer Rehman, etc. are not highly educated, and therefore, there was absence of mens rea and as a consequence the notice issued to them should be discharged.

[7] In the present proceedings, it is not for us to make a fac tual determination of the existence or otherwise of mens rea, this being an issue of fact. Learned counsel for respondents Ameer Mumtaz, etc. has, however, drawn our attention to an application filed on 3.11.2012 by Ameer Rehman, etc. This application is w ritten in Urdu and is signed by Ameer Rehman, etc. and makes mention of the order dated 18.02.1976.

[8] We, however, would not like to make any further comment as it may cause prejudice to the trial which we now propose to order. 2. In the foregoing circumsta nces, we send the matter to the learned Sessions Judge, Swat who shall entrust it to a competent Court for proceedings in accordance with law against Ameer Rehman, etc.

[9] For the reasons which we have given for taking notice of this matter, it is expected th at the trial shall be concluded expeditiously. A report shall be submitted in Court within six months from today for our perusal in Chambers. 3. We would like to add that perjury and fabrication of documentary evidence are to be taken very seriously by Co urts.

[10] This is necessary for ensuring that the administration of justice is not undermined and that baseless and false litigation is also deterred. The listed matters stand disposed of. CRP - :- No valid ground for review is made out. The review peti tion is, therefore, dismissed. Judge Judge Judge Islamabad, 1st July, 2015 M.
