[1] order dated 4.3.2020 passed by the Peshawar High Court D.I. Khan Bench in Cr. Misc. B.A. No.61 -D of 2020) Ghulam Abbas …Petitioner(s) Versus The State & another …Res pondent (s) For the Petitioner(s): Mr. Saleemullah Ranazai, ASC For the State : Ms. Aysha Tasneem, ASC Date of hearing : 04.06.2020. ORDER Qazi Muhammad Amin Ahmed, J. - Abdul Latif, deceased, along with Muhammad Hanif and Hafiz Muhammad Rafique, PWs, was on way to attend Court proceedings on 22.12.2004 when at 8:15 p.m. within the remit of Police Station City Dera Ism ail Khan , Ghulam Abbas petitioner , on a motorbike, driven by co-accused, subsequently identified as Iftikhar A hmed, intercepted the entourage; repeated fire shots fatally hit the deceased while Muhammad Hanif PW survived the gunshot.

[2] Previous blood feud is cited as motive for the crime . Petitioner stayed away from the law and was finally arrested on 14.1.2020; co-accused was acquitted during his absence. 2. Heard. Record perused. 3. Acquittal of co -accused , initially arrayed as unknown , has not been received as a valid ground for petitioner’s release on bail, both by the Court of Session as well as the High Court , a view found by us as unexceptionable.

[3] Similarly, petitioner’s advanced age with health, statedly frail, albeit with no specific disorder cann ot extenuate abscondance of almost 16 years having regard to the fatal role assigned Criminal Petition No. 445 of 2020 2 to him . Statements of the witnesses including an injured supported by medical evidence constitute “reasonable grounds ” within the contemplation of section 497 of the Code of Criminal Procedure 1898 , aggravated by petitioner’s absence going on for an age , unsurmountably stand in impediment to his release on bail, a concession discretionary in nature.

[4] View taken by the High Court, being within the bounds of law, does not call for interference. Petition fails. Leave declined. Judge Judge Judge Islamabad, the 4th June , 2020 Not approved for reporting Azmat /-
