[3] Shalimar, Lahore was lodged by the present petitioners against the opposite party (Respondent No,2 Muhammad Irfan Ali) under Sections 302,  PPC. However, the accused party also registered a cross-version against the present petitioners under Sections 337-A(iv), 337-A(ii), 337- F(iii), 337-F(i)/147 & 149 PPC.

[4] However, after thorough investigation, the police report under Section 173 Cr.P.C. was submitted in which petitioners were shown in column 2. The Trial Court did not concur with such report and while taking cognizance, vide order dated 08.06.2022 summoned the present petitioners to face the trial under the said offences challenged the said order before the Lahore High Court, Lahore in Criminal Revision No,55552 of 2022 on the grounds innocent who after thorough investigation by the police have been declared innocent as there is no material whatsoever to connect the present petitioners with the alleged offence, whereas, the petitioners are the eye-witnesses in FIR No. 1509 of 2021, therefore, they have been falsely implicated in a frivolous counter version case at the instance of accused persons.

[5] However, tlie learned Lahore High Court, vide impugned order has dismissed the Criminal Revision while observing that since there is medical legal report of injured Faizan, therefore, let the Trial Court after recording evidence decide the role or vicarious liability ofmentioned in the cross-version.

[6] The present petitionersCriminal Petition No,1315-L of2022 the FIR No. 1509 of 2021 registered at Police Station, the petitioners in counter version case.that the petitioners are 3 has the petitioners counsel for Learned 3. vehemently argued that the Trial Court as well as the learned Single Judge of the Lahore High Court, Lahore have seriously erred in law and facts while ignoring the fact that the FIR No.1509 of 2021 under Section 302,  PPC of the petitioners against the accused party was promptly lodged. and after proceeded are the eye-witnesses of the crime, whereas, in petitioners order to pressurize the witnesses and to prevent them from pursuing the criminal case against them, they have been learned counsel, the accused party, after inordinate delay. which has not been explained with mala-fide intention, got a cross-version of the same incidence, as a counterblast to wriggle out from criminal charges of murder against the accused persons in FIR No. 1509 of 2021.

[7] According to learned counsel, it is settled legal position that every criminal case, including a case of cross-version, has to be examined on the basis of the allegations contained in the FIR, and unless a cognizable case is made out, and there is some connecting material or evidence to connect the accused with the alleged offence, registration of a criminal case or to summon the proposed accused persons before Trial Court in such frivolous case is not warranted under law.

Perthorough investigation the criminal case hasCriminal Petition No. 1315-L of2022 against such accused persons wherein the ’U 4 Criminal Petition No.l315-L of2022 while showing their names in column No.2, whereas, both the learned Trial Court and HonT)le Lahore High Court, without pointing out any error or referring to any material or evidence have discarded the investigation in the instant case.

[9] It has been prayed that impugned order may be set aside. The perusal of record shows that the learned Trial 4. Court as well as the Lahore High Court, Lahore have failed to appreciate that the petitioners ai'e the eye-witnesses of a crime against the respondents in FIR No. 1509 of 2021 under allegedly caused by the respondents party, has already expired.

[10] Moreover, there is inordinate delay while introducing counter version, whereas, except some purported Medical report of injuries, which has been challenged before the Medical Board constituted pursuant to Court ’s order, where the accused in above FIR failed to appear for Medical Examination, the cognizance has been taken under Section 190 Cr.P.C. by the learned Trial Court, however, without summoning the Investigating Officer or pointing out any error or illegality in the process of investigation.

[11] In view of the facts and circumstances of the case, we are of the opinion that both the Courts have failed to examine the entire facts and the material, including the investigation of counter versionLahore wherein, respondents are facing trial, whereas, one of / the brother of the petitioners, on account of firearm injuries case, and could not refer to any factual error or legal infirmity while discarding the report furnished by the InvestigatingSections 302,  PPC at Police Station, Shalimar, A 5 Criminal Petition No.l315-L of2022 Officer under Section 173 Cr.P.C.
