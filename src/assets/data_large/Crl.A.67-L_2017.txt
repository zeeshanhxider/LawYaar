[2] Naseer -ud-Din Khan Nayyar , ASC (In Crl.A.67 -L/2017) Miss Najma Parveen, ASC (In Crl.A.68 -L/2017) For the State : Mr. Mazhar Sher Awan, Additional Prosecutor General Date of Hearing : 09.05.2019 JUDGMENT Qazi Muhammad Amin Ahmed , J.- Criminal Appeal No.67 -L/2017 by Safdar Baloch alias Ali and Criminal Appeal No.68 -L/2017 by Aziz Khan , through leave of the Court, arisen out of incident dated 15.12.2005 are bound by a common thread ; these are being decided through this single judgment. 2.

[3] Prosecution case is structured upon statement of Iftikhar Khan, PW -1; on the eventful day at about 7.30 a.m. he was about to leave home to drop his son namely Shahrayar Khan at the school when the appellants along with N azir Ahmed, co -accused , differently armed , confronted him. Safdar Baloch alias Ali and Nazir Ahmad shot him with .12 caliber guns on his left leg ; as he felled on the ground Aziz Khan, appellant took Shahryar, aged , Criminal Appeal No s.67-L & 68 -L of 2017 . 2 and whisked away in a car while dema nding a sum of Rs.500,000/ - as ransom .

[4] The complainant was rushed to Jinnah Hospital, Lahore; examined at 8.35 a.m. , he was noted with two entry wounds on left leg with corresponding exit s. Incident w as reported to the police at 11:4 0 a.m. In hot pursuit of the culprit s, Sardar Ali, ASI, intercepted car bearing No.LZV -9611 on a police picket ; the person on wheel decamped from the scene by scaling over an adjoining wall, while Naz ir Ahmad co-accused was subdued alongside the child .

[5] The appellants stayed awa y from law ; they were arrested on 8.7.2008 and 18.3.2009 respectively ; Naz ir Ahmad, co -accused had already faced trial with failures of his appeal s throughout. It is in this backdrop that the appellants were convicted under Section 365 -A of Pakistan Penal Code, 1860, Section 7(e) of Anti -Terrorism Act, 1997 and Section 324 read with Section 34 of the Code ibid; they are sentenced to death alongside collateral sentences for murderous assault .

[6] Their appeal s met with no better fate with capital sentence refere nce, returned in affirmative . 3. First glance cannot escape preponderance of prosecution ’s evidence ; Iftikhar Khan, PW undoubtedly endured the assault; he was me dially examined , noted to have injuries extensive in nature and consistent with the weapon s allegedly used in the crime.

[7] First Information Report was recorded with a remarkable promptitude with accused prominently named t herein ; vehicle mentioned in the crime report was intercepted same day at police picket alongside Nazir Ahmed, co -accused with t he child ; later appeared as a witness to point out his finger upon the appellants .

[8] However, certain intriguing aspects of the case warrant an independent and careful scrutiny of evidence . The fate of the present appellants is not linked with the outcome of trial of Nazir Ahmad, co-accused, for a variety of reasons. The foremost question is as to how the complainant nominated the accused merely after having their momentary glimpse s in a marriage ceremony few days before the occurrence .

[9] They were not with the child when the vehicle was intercepted , nor can it be held with certainty that the one who took to heels was one of them and this leaves Naz ir Ahmad, co -accused alone in the field. Statement of the child, Criminal Appeal No s.67-L & 68 -L of 2017 . 3 statedly of  years of age at the relevant time, certainly requires a very cautious scrutiny ; he is reticent on important details of the episode, relating to the present appellants; being of an impressionable age , having experienced the nightmare his susceptibility to tuition cannot be ruled out .

[10] Argume nt that crime report was recorded after arrest of Nazir Ahmed, co -accused and the appellants were named therein on the basis of information other than purportedly laid by the complai nant is not entirely beside the mark . While the occurrence cannot possibly be denied , nonetheless, nomination of the appellants on complainant’s knowledge is a circumstance fraught with doubts .

[11] A crowded ceremony would provide little space/opportunity to the complainant to remember the faces and names of the participants and thu s once the source of information about appellants’ participation in the crime is found suspect it would be unsafe to rely upon the testimony of a vulnerable witness alone , particularly when the appellants were not arrested alongside the co -accused.

[12] Crimina l liability is to be essentially settled on evidentiary certainty and not on moral sat isfaction or factualit ies incompatible with evidence based upon truth . Prosecution’s case against the appellants cannot be viewed as beyond reasonable doubt and thus conviction cannot be maintained without potential risk of error .

[13] Resultantly, criminal appeals are allowed , impugned judgment is set aside. The appellants shall be released forthwith, if not required in any ot her case. JUDGE JUDGE Lahore , the 09th of May, 2019 Ghulam Raza /* JUDGE
