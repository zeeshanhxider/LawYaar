[2] Tahir Hussain Khan, ASC (in Cr.P.9 -Q/2021) For the State: Mr. Walayat Hussain, Additional Prosecutor General Balochistan For the Complainant : Mr. Kamran Murtaza, Sr.ASC (in both cases) Date of hearing: 06.04.2021 . JUDGMENT Qazi Muhammad Amin Ahmed, J. - Ghulam Abbas petitioner was tried by a learned Additional Sessions Judge at Quetta for committing Qatl-i-Amd of Ameer Muhammad, , a supervisor employed in a restaurant at 6:1 5 p.m. on 10.8.2013 ; Naqeebullah petitioner , one of the owners of the outlet, was also in the dock for having screened of f incriminatory evidence ; they were returned a guilty verdict vide judgment dated 17.03.2017 ; the former convicted under clause (b) of section 302 of the Pakistan Penal Code, 1860 was sentenced to imprisonment for life with a direction to pay compensation whereas the latter was convicted under section 201 of the Code ibid; he was sentenced to 5-years R.I.

[3] The incident occurred all of a su dden in the wake of an altercation that started over a demand of drink by the principal accused . Criminal Petition Nos.9 -Q & 12 of 2021 2 The High Court of Balochistan maintained convictions as well as sentences recorded thereunder vide impugned judgment 21.12.2020 , being assailed through separat e petitions .

[4] Bound by a common thread, these are being decided through this single judgment. 2. According to the prosecution, the deceased served at the food outlet while Ghulam Abbas associated as a guard with Naqeebullah petitioner. On the fateful day, Ghulam Abbas asked the deceased for a drink who demanded a chit to oblige ; former , however, got infuriated and shot him in the abdomen ; he was subdued by the witnesses at the spot with the weapon, latter taken by Naqeebullah petitioner , who withheld it throughout .

[5] Ocular account furnished by Muhammad Awais ( PW-1) and Muhammad Afzal (PW -2), with an inspiring unanimity, narrated the graphic details of the episode ; they faced embarrassingly lengthy cross - examination without any setback. Red-handed arrest at t he spot foreclosed all avenues to entertain any hypothesis other than assassin’s guilt.

[6] Naqeebullah, however, attempted hard to wriggle out of the charge by taking plea of having extended assistance to the deceased in his gasping moments; according to him, he not only laid information with the police but also shifted the deceased to the hospital in a bid to save his life; he pleaded ignorance about the disappearance of weapon, held by the co-accused .

[7] Both the accused appeared as witnesses in disproof of th e charge , an attempt that failed to disturb preponderance of prosecution . 3. Appraisal of evidence by the court s below , upon our own independent analysis , has been found by us inconsonance with the principles of safe administration of criminal justice .

[8] It is a broad daylight affair wherein Ghulam Abbas was apprehended at the spot ; he was employed by Naqeebullah as a guard, who had obviously provided him the weapon that he used most unwise ly, without provocation upon a hapless worker , earning livelihood fo r his family; he has already been dealt with leniency .

[9] Criminal Petit ion No. 9-Q of 2021 fails. Leave declined. Assistance provided to the deceased in his injured condition by Naqeebullah petitioner does not absolve him from his responsibility to assist t he law, however, at the most can be viewed as a mitigation to settle quantum of the sentence which having regard to the totality of circumstances is reduced from 5 -years to 3-years R.I , pre -trial period inclusive.

[10] Fine imposed by the Courts below in the s um of Rs.50,000/ - is converted into compensation , to be paid to the legal heirs of the deceased; default shall follow simple imprisonment for six months. With the above Criminal Petition Nos.9 -Q & 12 of 2021 3 modification , Criminal Petition No.12 of 2021 is converted into appeal and partly allowed in the above terms.
