Shafique Ahmed who was lying on the bed , all of a sudden three persons duly armed with pistol entered into the room.

[4] His wife made a shriek on seeing them, his father g ot up from the bed and by raising Lalkara made an attempt to catch hold of one of the accused. At the same time one of the accused fired with his pistol hitting his father on his neck who fell down on the ground . The third accused kept watch while holding pistol in his h and and also threatened them that if any one of them made an attempt to move he would be met with the same fate.

One of the accused kept watch on the inmates of room while holding pistol and also continued threatening them. The accused remained in his house for  minutes and thereafter scaled over the wall behind the house u pon which he and others raised hue and cry attracting their neighbors.

Accused persons involved in the commission of offence were arrest ed and following six persons were sent up to answer the charge : - 1. Ghulam Abbas 2. Arshad Masih. 3. Iftikhar Ahmad alias Chand 4.

[7] Irfan Javed alias Bhaia. 5. Munir Ahmad. 6. Shaukat Ali. Learned Trial Court vide judgment dated 6th November 1997 convicted/awarded fo llowing sentences to the accused persons : - Crl.P.848 -L/2002 etc 3 U/s 458 PPC Iftikhar Ahmed @ Chand, Arshad Masih and Ghulam Abbas 14 years R.I. with payment of fine of Rs.50,000/ - and in default whereof to suffer further two years R.I. each.

Learned High Court, however, up -held the sentence of death of one of the petitioner namely Ghulam Abbas, whereas sentence awarded to Arshad Masih and Iftikhar Ahmed alias Chand was reduced to life imprisonment.

[11] Sentence awarded to other convicts namely Arfan Javaid @ Bhaia, Munir Ahmed and Shauka t Ali was reduced to seven years R.I. As far as remaining sentences under Section 396 PPC awarded to the convicts were maintained by the High Court by means of impugned judgment. Listed petitions have been filed on behalf of convicts for leave to appeal. 3.

[12] Learned counsel appearing in Civil Petition No.848 -L of 2002 contended that in accordance with the provisions of Section 391 read with Section 396 PPC , the accused deserve for same sentence as they are all equally responsible for the commission of offenc e. On having reduced the sentence of the other convicts , the sentence of the petitioner Ghulam Abbas is not liable to be maintained.

[13] To substantiate his plea he placed reliance upon the cases of Puranmal Agarwalla and others v. Rautmal Pincha (AIR 1953 “Assam 44), Shivappa and others v. Hyderabad State (AIR 1955 Hyd. 147), Geedo and others v. the State (1986 P.Cr.L.J. 2192), Crl.P.848 -L/2002 etc 4 Abdul Qayyum and others v. The State (PLD 2004 Karachi 232), Khalid Mehmood and four others v.

[14] The State (2004 SCMR 199). 4. It may be noted that as far as convict Munir Ahmed is concerned he entered into compromise with the L.Rs. of the deceased whereas Arfan Javed @ Bhaia and Shaukat Ali are contesting the conviction awarded to them. As far as question in respect of accept ance or otherwise of the compromise is concerned , it will be dealt with in view of the judgment in the case of Muhammad Rawab v.

[15] The State (2004 SCMR 1170). However, at this stage having seen the law relied upon by the learned counsel of the petitioner -Ghulam Abbas, prima faci e, we are of the opinion that if the sentence of death of Ghulam Abbas is maintained then remaining convicts would also be liable to the sentence for death.

[16] Therefore, while grating leave to appeal in their cases as well notices be a lso issued to them to explain as to why their sentences may also not be enhanced. Thus f or the above reasons, inter alia, to examin e the contentions put forward by the learned for petitioners as well as merits of the case to the extent of other accused p ersons, leave to appeal is granted.
