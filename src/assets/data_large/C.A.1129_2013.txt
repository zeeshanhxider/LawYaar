[1] order dated 04.4.2012 passed by Lahore High Court, Lahore in W.P. No.3974 of 2005 Major ® P ervez Iqbal Appellant (s) Versus Muhammad Akram Almas, etc. Respondent(s) For the Appellant (s): Mian Ashaq Hussain, ASC Ch. Akhtar Ali, AOR For Respondent No.1: Mian Asrar ul Haq, Sr. ASC For Respondent No.3: Tehseen Sadiq, Addl.

[2] Co mmissioner (FBR) For Respondent No.5: Nemo Date of Hearing: 10.01.201 7 JUDGMENT Mushir Alam, J -. Appellant has impugned order dated 04.4.2012 whereby the learned Judge in Chambers of the Lahore High Court, Lahore dismissed the CMA No.2565 of 2009 , under section 12(2) of the CPC , challenging the judgment of the v ery Court dated 25.4.2007 , whereby W rit Petition No.3974 of 2005 , filed by one Muhammad Akram Almas , Respondent No.1 herein, seeking writ of mandamus, against the Income Tax Authorit ies to issue sale certificate and possession of the property of tax defaulter , purchased by him in open auction and, further direction to the Military Estate Officer (MEO) and others to affect mutation of said property in his favour , which was allowed. 2.

[3] Leave in the matter was granted vide order dated 5.9.2013 , which reads as follow: - “Submits that respondent No.1 filed a constitution petition seeking a direction that the Income Tax Department should issue a sale certificate in his favour pursuant to the auction of petitioner’s property measuring 7 Kanals at a paltry amount of Rs.20,54,047/ - Civil Appeal No.1129 of 2013 2 not withstanding the fact that the sale in auction had abated in view of Rule 150 read with Rule 111 of the Income Tax Rules, 1982; that respondent himself gave i ncorrect address of the petitioner in the writ petition filed by him, on account of which petitioner was neither served nor heard by the learned High Court while passing the judgment dated 25.4.2007. 2.

[4] Having heard petitioner’s learned counsel at some le ngth, leave is granted inter alia to consider the issue raised. ” 3. In order to appreciate the controversy raised in the instant appeal , it would be necessary to recapitulate facts f orming matrix of controversy. 4. Appellant , adjudged tax defaulter , after service of a show cause notices as required under the law, he was arrested on 22.8.2000 ; he was released on commitment to clear the dues in installments.

[5] However, on his failure to adhere to such payment schedule , he was again arrested and produced bef ore the Tax Recovery Officer (TRO) on 23.12.2000 . The appellant in order to earn his release , per rules disclosed the property subject matter of instant proceedings , gave consent in his own writing for the attachment and auction of the property , for the re covery of tax dues , as a result thereof , subject property was attached and put to auction after fulfilling all the requirements of Rules 141 & 142 of IT Rule , 1982 .

[6] Auction succeeded second time and the respondent No.1 was declared successful on 31.5.2001 , entire amount of Rs. 64,25,000 /- was deposited within time . Auction purchaser also paid additional amount of Rs.1 ,92,750/- as gain tax on the sale of this property , which otherwise was payable by the appellant. 5.

[7] From the record it seems that Military Es tate Officer (MEO), requested for the deferment of the sale on the ground, inter alia; that the property has not been mutated in the name of the appellant . The matter s huttled between the TRO, MEO and Station Commander Head Quarter , Sialkot Cantt without a ny resolution .

[8] From the record it appears that the appellant succeeded in obtaining a decree dated 21.12. 1994 in a Civil Suit No., for specific performance in respect of subject property held on old grant by the previous owners . In execution procee dings, conveyance deed dated 2.3.2000 was executed in his favour, however, for obvious reasons he Civil Appeal No.1129 of 2013 3 did not followed up his application for the mutation of subject property in his favour from the MEO, apparently, for this reason his name was not recorded in the General Land Register (GLR) maintained by the MEO, which provided a cause to the MEO, to make request to defer the auction. 6.

[9] Respondent No.1, when failed to obtain the sale certificate from TRO, needed for effecting mutation of the property in his name, as a l ast resort filed Writ Petition No.3974 of 2005 , which as noted above was allowed on 25.4.2007 and the Income Tax Authorities were directed to issue sale certificate , which was issued in favour of the Respondent No.1 , on 2.5.2007.

[10] MEO was also directed to consider the application for mutation of the auction purchaser in accordance with law. MEO unsuccessfully challenged the order of the High Court , before this Court through Civil Appeal No.529 -L of 2009 , which was d ismissed vide order dated 20.7 .2011; however, right of the appellant to pursue his Application under section 12(2) CPC ; (filed on 01.6.2009) then pending before the learned Lahore High Court was preserved .

[11] The application , was ultimately heard and dismissed , vide impugned order, essent ially on the ground that the appellant had neither challenged nor, availed the remedy against the auction in terms of Rule 127 of Income Tax Rules, 2002 (contemporary Rule 106 of IT Rules 1982 ). 7. Mian Ashiq Hu ssain, learned ASC appearing for the appell ant, vehemently contended that on the application made by the MEO/Station Commander , the TRO had deferred the sale vide order dated 30.6.2001 available at page No.86 of the main paper book , which according to learned ASC amounted to setting aside of the auction sale in terms of Rules 111, 141 and 15 0 of IT Rules , 1982 requiring fresh proclamation , which was not issued .

[12] Therefore, auction if any , is of no consequences. To a specific que ry of the Court , learned counsel c andidly conceded that the appellant did not challenge the auction sale held on 31.5.2001. He however , maintained that under the law auction sale could be challenged by any person and in instant case it was challenged by the MEO, in accordance with IT Rules, 1982.

[13] It was next urged that , impugne d judgment of the High Court is a result of fraud and misrepresentation, correct address of the appellant was not disclosed by the Respondent No.1, appellant has not been heard, impugned judgment is liable to be setaside. Civil Appeal No.1129 of 2013 4 8. Mian Asrar ul Haq, learned Sen ior ASC appearing for the respondent No.1 vehemently opposed the appeal .

[14] According to him auction was held with the consent of appellant . Auction, succeed in second attempt on 31.5.2001 . Respondent No.1/ Auction purchaser had deposited the entire sale consi deration within time . It was urged that since the auction purchaser was denied the sale certificate on the intervention of MEO, on wholly unjustified grounds, who otherwise had no interest in the property , therefore he was compelled to file writ petition , which was allowed .

[15] It was argued that appellant consented to the attachment and auction of subject property . According to him , Sale Certificate was issued on 2.5.2007 on the directions of High Court ; appellant had a right to challeng e the auction /sale within 30 days from the date thereof under the IT Rules 1982, which he failed .

[16] He cannot be allowed to challenge the auction , through ‘collateral proceedings’ under section 12 (2) CPC filed on 1.6.2009 after more than 8 years . 9. Mr. Tehseen Sadiq, Additiona l Commissioner (FBR) representing Tax Authorities, also supported the impugned order. According to him, attachment and auction of the appellant ’s property was c arried out strictly in accordance with Income Tax Act , 1979 and IT Rules, 1982.

[17] The appellant was given several opportunities to clear his dues, which he failed. Appellant volunteered the attachment and auction , which was held twice, to his knowledge, which he never challenged before the TRO and or the hierarchy provided under the IT Rules 1982 . 10. We have heard the argument s and perused the record.

[18] Admittedly appellant was adjudged a tax defaulter , Certificate to such an effect in terms of sub section (1) of section 93 of the Income Tax Ordinance, 1979 read with Rule 100 of the IT Rules 1982 was issued by the Income Tax Officer to the TRO , to effect the recovery, by attachment, arrest and sale of the property of the defaulter /Appellant .

[19] There is also no dispute as to the service of the show cause notice under section 93 (1) of Income Tax Act, 1 979 read with Rule 162(1) of the Income Tax Rules , 1982. It is not denied by the appellant that he was arrested and he agreed to pay dues in installments, which commitment he could not adhere d.

[20] It is a matter of record that h e was again arrested and produc ed before the TRO on 23.12.2000 and, in order to earn his release , the appellant disclose d his whole of the Civil Appeal No.1129 of 2013 5 property and place d the same at the disposal of TRO for the recovery of tax dues in terms of Rule 167 (1) of IT Rules 1982 , which reads as follows: - “167.

[21] Release --(1) The Tax Recovery Officer may order the release of a defaulter who has been arrested in execution of a Certificate upon being satisfied that he has disclosed the whole of his property and has placed it at the disposal of the Tax Recovery Officer and that he has not committed any act in bad faith.” The appellant in terms of above rule also authorised the TRO to auction the said property and recover the amount due, endorsement in his writing reads as under: - 弥㱾 ᚪ ᄸ ࿀ م嗚 ᣲے ذا哶" ⸞惪 ذر㺸 䉺ا㍗ ۔ᣗ 婨 اد弹᱑ 䪬叅㖓 娛 ୉ ٹၩ㥃 ل㯵 ت⡜ 愡ا٣٧ ࿀ م嗚 ے哶 啵 㺘 ٹ䞶ⴤ ⠪ر吴٠٠٠٢۔٣٠۔٢٠ ᡁ 䅏峤 ى᳸ ر㱾 孆 ر㨱 ጦ ኸ㥃 㷨 ى᳸ ر㷨 ᳮ ࿀ر㊓ 媛婧㞑 乇 㱾 ᭛࿀ا࿀ ں۔ اس峤 Attach اس䬈 㺸 رى慢 رᄣ ا㺸 㨱 㱾 Auction 㨱 㷨 ۔ اس㻠峤 婨 اض㌬ ا弥㱾 䶵 ᠢ ے Attachment 愡 ا㷨 "۔嵉 徇د㨱 ⣶د آج د⠩ 嬸 啵 ࿀ ኸ㥃 11.

[22] Consequently , his property was attached second time , in terms of rule 137 of the IT Rules 1982. It is a matter of record that, an attempt to obtain sta y from Civil Court failed and so also Lahore High Court in Civil Revision No.1261 of 2001 declined any indulgence to stay the auction vide order dated 7.06.2001.

[23] Subject property was auctioned on 31.5.2001; Respondent No.1 was declared the successful bidde r. Appellant was fully aware of the auction, chose not to avail the remedy under Rule 111, 149 and or Rule 150 of IT Rules 1982 and did not challenged the auction till before 1.6.2009, that too in a collateral proceedings under section 12 (2) CPC . 12.

[24] In terms of scheme of IT Rules 1982, w here no application is made for setting aside the sale of the attached property under Rule 149 or 150 of the Rules ibid; or where any such application is made and is dismissed, the TRO, in terms of Rule 152 ibid is obliged, on payment of entire bid amount , to confirms the sale, which than becomes absolute and consequently TRO is further obligated in terms of Rule 15 4 of the IT Rules 1982 to issue the Sale Certificate.

[25] Civil Appeal No.1129 of 2013 6 13. The Respondent No.1 being declared successful b idder having paid the entire bid amount in the sum of Rs.64,25,000/ - on 14.6.2001 and further sum of Rs.1,92,750 as gain tax due and payable by the appellant. Respondent was denied sale certificate and became victim of brawl between the TRO and MEO, filed W.P No.3974 of 2005 dated 11.3.2005, before the Lahore High Court seeking writ of mandamus against the TOR and MEO, to perform their legal duties, which Writ Petition was allowed on 25.4.2007, consequently TRO issued Sale Certificate to the Respondent No. 1 on 2.5.2007 . 14.

[26] It may be observed that sub-section (4) of section 93 of the Ordinance, 1979 bestows on the TRO similar power as are vested in a Civil Court for the recovery of amount under a decree . Provisions contained in Chapter IX (Rules 99 to 190 ) of the IT Rules, 1982 are complete Code akin to provisions of Order 21 rule 82 to rule 104 CPC, where by the tax defaulter and or any person having any right or interest in the property attached and or sold pursuant to attachment order for the recovery of arrears of tax, may seek stoppage of sale, (Rule 111 ibid) challenge such auction/ sale, before the TRO, (as provided for under Rule 149 and 150 respectively of Rules ibid).

[27] Against any order of sale hierarchy of appeal under Rule 173 , which is subjected t o Revision under Rule 1 74 and Review under Rule 175 ibid; is provided , thus elaborate procedure for attachment and sale of immovable property of the defaulter and host of remed ies pre and post auction/ sale are provided under the Income Tax Rules, 1982 .

[28] It is settled position in law that where special law provides elaborate mechanism and procedure to challenge certain action under the scheme of special law, recourse to general law and or challenge to such action , that too through collateral proceedings are n ot approved . Neither the Appellant nor any other respondents herein filed any application against the auction of the subject property within the contemplation of IT Rule 1982 .

[29] In instant case rule 111 ibid, which may justify stoppage of sale , on satisfacto ry proof of payment of tax dues, before the hammer is struck down in favour of the highest bidder , was not availed by the appellant , thus it cannot be pressed into service . 15. Arguments of learned ASC for the appellant, that the objections filed by the MEO could always be treated as an application Civil Appeal No.1129 of 2013 7 under Rule 149 or Rule 150 ibid; are flawed for the simple reasons that sale under referred rule s could only be annulled on meeting twin conditions set down therein ; with a rider that such challenge is made within 30 days from the date of sale .

[30] First condition is the deposit of the amount mentioned in the proclamation of sale with 8% interest and second is to pay a sum equal to 10% of the purchase money to the purchaser , admittedly such conditions as noted herein were neither met by the MEO nor by the appellant, therefore, the objections of MEO, which even otherwise, were on altogether different premise, could not be treated as challenge to auction sale under the referred rules.

[31] The appellant cannot question sal e on the ground of irregularity in service in terms of Ru le 150 ibid; when he himself had authorised the attachment and sale of his property as noted above . It may be observed that any error or irregularity in or in publishing or conduct of sale of immovea ble property in terms of Rule 134 does not vitiate sale .

[32] Even otherwise , all such ground s, if at all available could have been raised before the form and hierarchy provided under the IT Rules 1982 and not in collateral proceedings under section 12(2) CPC . 16. As noted above, elaborate provisions contained in Chapter IX of the IT Rules, 1982 are self contained code , providing elaborate procedure for the recovery of tax arrears, attachment, arrest and sale of property of defaulter and challenge to sale by th e defaulter and or any other person having interest in the attached and sold property .

[33] Admittedly, the appellant who was adjudged tax defaulter in contested legal proceedings up to the High Court. Appellant failed to challenge the sale before a competent forum in the manner provided as discussed above , cannot be allowed to challenge the sale , in a collateral proceeding s arising out of a writ of mandamus against the Income Tax Authorities and MEO for the issuance of Sale Certificate and effecting mutation in his name . 17.

[34] In this view of the matter, f inding no merit s in this appeal , it is accordingly dismissed. JUDGE JUDGE ISLAMABAD, THE 10th January, 201 7 arshed/* Approved for Reporting
