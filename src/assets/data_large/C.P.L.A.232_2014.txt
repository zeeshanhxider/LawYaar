[1] ORDER This case has been going on before us since 28.11.2014 when the first order in the case was passed. Since then there have been ten orders which have been passed . The order sheet containing these orders shows that ther e prima -facie appears to be a lack of diligent effort on the part of NAB as an institution.

[2] First ly out of the four co -accused only one Fiaz Ahmed Khan had been apprehended while the other three who are brothers namely Jameel, Hameed and Am een were at large. Today we asked the I.O. present in Court to let us see the case diaries. A very cursory examination of these shows that in fact no diligent efforts had been made for the arrest of the three brothers named above.

[3] We also note that it is only after we had taken not ice of this laxity and lack of due diligence on the part of the NAB , that two of the brothers namely Jameel and Hameed were apprehended. Ameen is still at large. 2. Another strange thing has become eviden t during the hearing toda y. The I.O. Rai Nasir Iqbal is present.

[4] In the case files he has made a note on 02.02.2015 wherein he has written that “he is under severe internal as well as external pressure as accused Fiaz Ahmed and his counsel Barriste r CP No. 2132 of 2014 (1) 2 Khurram has conveyed a message to {him} that they have transferred DG and now they will get undersigned arrested by S.C. as Barrister Khurram said that he has contacts with judges of higher judiciary.” These diaries are on loose paper s.

[5] When questioned, the I.O. stated that the message was conveyed to him through Mr. Amjad Majeed Olak, who is Additional Director, NAB but the name of Mr. Olak has not been mentioned in the aforesaid diary. The I.O. further stated that he had informed his superiors but again there appears to be nothing on r ecord to indicate that this was done.

[6] On the contrary , Admiral (R) Saeed Ahmed Sargana, Deputy Chairman, NAB states that there was no such intimation as far as he is aware. This represents very serious mal administration and want of proper procedures, supe rvision etc. within NAB. 3. It is worth mentioning that even a cursory examination of the initial few pages of the case diaries show s that no effort worth the name was made to interrogate or apprehend the accused persons.

[7] On the contrary repeated notices were sent starting from April 2011 onwards to the accused asking them to appear but they chose not to do so. No action appears to have been taken thereafter to convert the inquiry into an investigation and to apprehend these accused persons. According to t he learned Prosecutor General where a person does not appear in an inquiry, the inquiry is converted into an investigation and the accused pers ons are arrested.

[8] This clearly w as not done in the present case , for approximately four years . 4. We are also v ery concerned that an investigating officer of NAB should not be able to deal with or tackle threats or perceived threats because if th is is indeed the case he should be dealt with appropriately by the NAB authorities . 5.

[9] On the last date of hearing we we re informed that seven officers of NAB had been proceeded again st and had been charge sheeted . Today , on inquiry, the learned Prosecutor General has stated that the inquiry is in progress. From the dates given by him it appears that the disciplinary procee dings are not being pursued diligently because even according to the learned Prosecu tor General seven days time is available to the charge sheeted employee to respond to the charge sheet.

[10] In respect of six of the above named seven employees, the seven day period lapsed on 13.02.2015 while in respect of seventh, the said period expired on 16.02.2015. Despite this there is no indication that anything has been done in furthering the disciplinary process. The said officers even today continue to be working in N AB as before .

[11] It is CP No. 2132 of 2014 (1) 3 stated by the Deputy Chairman NAB that they have been transferred to some other positions. The noting in the police diary of 02.02.2015 also mentions that “if interim bail of Fiaz is contested in Supreme Court, internal message of Chair man NAB is conveyed to me that if Supreme Court summons him, he will take action against me. ” 6.

[12] Since Amin accused has still not been apprehended there appears to be reason to believe that keeping in view the case diaries there might have been assistance prima -facie from within NAB to enable Amin and his two brothers Jameel and Hameed (now under arrest) , to evade arrest. We were informed that proceedings under Sections 87 and 88 of the Cr.P.C. have been undertaken in respect of the absconding accused.

[13] Howe ver on further questioning it has become clear that no property belonging to Amin is under attachme nt. 7. The above state of affairs is not satisfactory at all. We have tried our level best to try and find out if some effective procedures are in place wit hin NAB which can be considered as sufficient to ensure diligence and efficiency in pursuing those in respect of whom N .A.O. was promulgated .

[14] Since satisfactory arrangements appear not to be in place and therefore the situation as the present one ha s arise n, we direct that this case be listed for hearing tomorrow at Sl. No. 1 at 9:30 am.. The Chairman, NAB shall also be present tomorrow.
