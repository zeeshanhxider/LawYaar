[2] Sultan Mazhar Sher Khan, Additional Advocate General, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa a/w Mr. Mehmood Ghaznavi, D.E.O. (Male) Chitral Respondent No.1: In person. Date of hearing: 11 December 2023 ORDER Qazi Faez Isa, CJ. This is yet anothe r prime example of frivolous litigation being initiated by a provincial government.

[3] The petitioner s had advertised in the year 2018 for the selection of two computer teachers in basic pay scale of 12 and had prescribed the minimum qualification as Intermed iate with one year diploma in computer sciences. The respondent No.1 held a B.Sc. and M.Sc. degree in computer science and came on the top of the merit list but still was not appointed for the reason that he was over -qualified.

[4] It appears that those in cha rge of educating the children of the province were bereft of common sense by disqualifying a person who was more qualified and thus better placed to impart computer science education and favoured one less qualified . Not only the respondent No.1 was made to suffer but the children , who would have benefit ed from his knowledge , were condemned . 2.

[5] There is no reason to interfere with the impugned judgment. Leave to appeal is declined and this petition is dismissed with cost s incurred by the respondent No.1, tha t is two hundred thousand rupees to be paid to the respondent No.1 on or before 31 December 2023. Needless to state the judgment regarding appointment of respondent No.1 will also be implemented by or before such date , and if it is not complied with, the Secretary, Elementary & Secondary Education, Government of Khyber CP-225-P of 2023.doc 2 Pakhtun khwa may be proceeded against for contempt of Court.

[6] A copy of this order be sent to the petitioners and the respondents , to the Advocate General, Chief Secretary and Secretary Law of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa who will undoubtedly ensure that the government does not generate such unnecessary litigation and then, for no valid legal reason, challenge the decisions of the High Court which also drain s the resources of the government, paid for by the taxpayers.
