[1] order dated 09.10.2021 passed by the High Court of Balochistan , Quetta in Crl. Bail Application N o.) Salman Khan ...….Petitioner(s) Versus The State . …….Respondent(s) For the petitioner(s): Mr. Kamran Murtaza , Sr. ASC. For the state: Qazi Mushtaq Ahmed, Addl. P.G. Balochistan For the c omplainant: Mr.

[2] Amir Muhammad Lehri, ASC. Date of hearing: 13.01.2022 ORDER Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, J. - The p etitioner seeks leave to appeal against the order dated 09.10.2021 passed by the High Court of Balochistan, whereby post -arrest bail has been denied to him in case FIR No. registered at P.S. Sariab, for offences punishable under Section s 302, 324 and 34, PPC . 2.

[3] The allegation in the crime report against the petitioner , a member of the Eagle Squad (a law enforcement agency) , briefly stated is that four members of the Eagle Squad , including the petitioner, signaled the car of the complainant to stop but he conti nued to drive on, whereupon the petitioner fired at the car, which ended up in causing injuries to the complaina nt and death of his cousin, Faizan, who was also seated in t he car . 3.

[4] We have heard the parties and examined the record. The petitioner and others members of the Eagle Squad were on their routine duty of maintaining law and order in the city , at the time of incident . There is nothing on record to show that there was a background of any enmity between the parties , or the incident was the result of some provocation, or the petitioner fired at the car that had tainted glasses, Crl.

[5] P. 127 -Q/2021 (2) with the intention to cause death of the complainant and his cousin. From t he contents o f the crime report , it appears that an offence of qatl- bis-sabab punishable under S ection 322 PPC is made out other than qatl-i-khata punishable under section 319, PPC. However, qatl-i-amd under section 302 does not appear to be made out in the present fac ts and circumstances of the case .

[6] Section 322, PPC falls outside the prohibitory clause of Section 497(1) , CrPC1 while section 319, PPC is bailable . That being so, the detention of the petitioner pending trial can only be justified if t his case falls withi n the scope of any of the exceptions stated in the cases of Tariq Bashir2, Muhammad Tanveer3 and Zafar Iqbal .4 There is , however, nothing on record that may attract any of the said exceptions and justify denial of post arrest bail to the petitioner . 4.

[7] The High Court has not exercised its discretion judiciously in denying the relief of post arrest bail to the petitioner. This petition is , therefore, converted into appeal and allowed: the impugned order is set aside and the bail application of the petitione r is accepted . The petitioner is admitted to bail subject to his furnishing the bail bond in the sum of Rs.100,000/ - with one surety each in the like amount to the satisfaction of the trial Court. 5.

[8] Needless to mention that the observations made in this order are of tentative nature which shall not in any manner influence the trial court, and that this con cession of bail may be cancelled, under Section 497(5) CrPC , if the petitioner misuse s it in any manner, includi ng causing delay in the expeditious conc lusion of the trial .
