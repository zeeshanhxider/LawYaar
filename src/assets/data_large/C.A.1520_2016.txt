Ozair Chughtai, AOR Date of hearing: 13.11.2019 JUDGMENT Qazi Muhammad Amin Ahmed, J.

[3] Ms. Jahan Afroz Khilat , respondent, inherited from her father’s estate, as a minor, land measuring 2722 -Kanal 12 Marla ; after her marriage, she settled in the United States , where she continued to receive her share of produce; she returned in the year 1989 to learn that her entire share stood mutated in favour of his nephew Meesam Mehdi Raza Khan , way b ack on 10.8.1968 , through the good offices of his father Ameer Ali Raza Hayat Khan, her real brother .

[4] It is in evidence that the transferee was aged about 1 ½ year at the time of mutation . Through various transactions, the land passed on different hands, each arrayed as defendant in the suit , dismissed by the learned trial Judge vide judgment and decree dated 24.11.2011 . The Appellate Court reversed the findings vide judgment and decree dated Civil Appeal Nos1520, 1521 & 1522 of 2016 2 14.09.2004 , upheld by a learned Judge -in-Chamber of Lahore High Court vide consolidated judgment dated 20.10.2015 , vires whereof are being assailed through the captioned appeals by leave of the Court ; bound by a common thread, these are being decided through this single judgment. 2.

[5] Learned counsel for the appellants , in a unison, contend that the appellants are bonafide purchasers with consideration and, thus, the learned trial Court had rightly dismissed the suit and there was no occasion for the learned Appellate Court as well the learned Judge -in-Chamber to take a contra view ; that the suit was not maintainable , as according to them, admittedly the plaintiff/respondent was not in possession of the suit land , otherwise doomed for being hopelessly barred by time .

[6] The bottom line is that the land was consciously alienated by the family, respondent ’s being on board in each transaction . Reference to the entire estate by the High Court is lastly pressed into service to argue that the findings returned by the High Court, transcend f ar beyond the original decree and, thus, intervention by this Court would be most called for.

[7] Learned counsel for the respondents has defended the impugned judgment on the ground that the impugned transaction was nothing but a farce inasmuch as the respondent was minor at the time when impu gned mutation was purportedly transacted ; he has relied upon the doctrine of caveat emptor to argue that the appellants could not defend their title in the face of a transaction, void ab initio .

[8] Period of limitation could not stand in impediment to respondents’ claim, concluded the learned counsel . 3. Heard . Record perused. 4. Competing claims, notwithstanding , respondent’ s title in her father’s estate to the extent of 2722 -Kanal 12 -Marla, as a minor daughter is a common ground ; being a female, in a Muslim household, it was h er due, conferred by Divine Law , recognized by the law of the land ; it is so ordained in Sura Al -Nisa() , reproduced below ﱠُ ﻓِﻲ أَوْﻻَدِﻛُمْ ۖ စ ﯾُوﺻِﯾﻛُمُ ﻟِﻠذﱠﻛَرِ ﻣِﺛْلُ ﺣَظِّ اﻷُْﻧْﺛَﯾَﯾْنِ ۚ ﻓَﺈِنْ ﻛُنﱠ ﻧِﺳَﺎءً ﻓَوْقَ اﺛْﻧَﺗَﯾْنِ ﻓَﻠَﮭُنﱠ ﺛُﻠُﺛَﺎ ﻣَﺎ ﺗَرَكَ ۖ وَإِنْ ﻛَﺎﻧَتْ وَاﺣِدَةً ﻓَﻠَﮭَﺎ اﻟﻧِّﺻْفُ ۚ ◰ 啵 ܉رے㺸 (᯺ ورا㷨) د䆨رى اوឨ ឫ 䡠ا ▗ ࢑ا࢑㺸 ں㺮䒳 دو䰋 㺸 㺸䒳 㲁 嵗 徱د ( دو徉 ں )دو峤 峭 ں㷩䒳 فエ 㽻 اᇆ ،嵗 府 زا⸞ وہ㽻، اور ا嵗 ▗ 弥ᠤ دو㥃 㲁ᔊ اس䰋 㺸 انᠢ 嵗 嵢 آد䰋 㺸 اسᠢ 峤 㹽ا Civil Appeal Nos1520, 1521 & 1522 of 2016 3 Given the preponderance of conferment, s uch a right, rooted into Personal Law , has to be jealously guarded , therefore, a heavy onus is cast upon the claimant to dem onstrate that a female legatee had parted with her entitlement by choice and for consideration s, consciously , without duress or uncalled for persuasions , by those placed qua her in advantageous positions .

[9] It is not merely an invasion into proprietary rights of a woman but a criminal offence punishable under section 498 -A of the Pakistan Penal Code, 1860 (Act XLV of 1860) as well . In the present case, any one with ordinary prudence , would fail to find any rational, prompting a minor gi rl hardly of 13 years of age to alienate a considerable chunk of land in favour of her minor nephew aged less than two years ; she was otherwise incompetent under the law to mutate the land ; it sans solemnity as well .

[10] A momentary glance of the entry, exposes the deceit inherent in the mutation , reproduced for convenience of reference ‘ ر㐓 哶ا 㷩 ن൞ 嬸 ن⛪ ت⚒ ㅨ ہ岀 ى哶 㲁 嵗 嬸 ᄭ ا㇒ ارا 䡴⡜ ᄣا ۔嵗 دى㨱 匥 ෧ م嗚 㺸 ௲ ٶ ǔ ِ Ǐ Ϻ ᳸ درج ر㡃ا وا 嵗 ࡈرጦ 㺸 㨱’ It is recorded in flagrant violation of procedure, provided under section 42 of the West Pakistan Land Revenue Act, 1967 ( XVII of 1967) .

[11] There is none except Ameer Ali Raza Hayat Khan to command transfer of land in favour of his own son to his benefit and to the detriment of the respondent, no other than his real minor sister ; flux of time can neither validate the transaction nor wash away the repugnance thereof . Argument that much w ater has flown under the bridge is entirely beside the mark .

[12] Limitation never run against fr aud, more so in the matters involving inheritance rights of a female; a view consistently taken by this Court in cases reported as Fazal Ellahi deceased through legal heirs Vs. Mst. Zainab Bi (2019 SCMR 1930), Khan Muhammad through LRs & others Vs. Mst. Khatoon Bibi & others (2017 SCMR 1476 ), Mahmoo d Khan Vs.

[13] Syed Khalid Hussain Shah (2015 SCMR 869 ), Mst. Gohar Khanum Vs. Mst. Jamila Jan (2014 SCMR 801 ), Rehmat Ullah & others Vs. Saleh Khan & others (2007 SCMR 729 ), Arshad Khan Vs. Resham Jan and others (2005 SCMR 1859) and Ghulam Ali & 2 other Vs. Mst. Ghulam Sarwar Naqvi (PLD 1990 SC 1 ). Reference to period of limitation is otherwise misplaced; it is respondent’s case, in line with the pleadings and re -affirmed in the Civil Appeal Nos1520, 1521 & 1522 of 2016 4 witness -box, that she kept on receiving her share of produce while being in the United States wherefrom she returned in the year 1989 and learnt about the impugned mutation as late as in the year 1991 soon whereafter she instituted the suit .

[14] Similarly argument that the appellants being innocent buyers with considerations should not suffer from the consequences of a wrong done upon the respondent by her own kith and kin , though evokes sympathy, nonetheless, does not hold water in law . Doctrine of ‘caveat emptor ’ is a well entrenched principle in our jurisprudence; it requires the buyer to be vigilant and careful as he cannot acquire a better title; as observed above, a glance over the mutation would have inescapably exposed the flaw patent therein , putting the potential buyers at caution .

[15] Non-maintainability of the suit on the plea of respondent’s being out of possession is an argument that too carries no weight ; respondent being a co-sharer in the estate is deemed to be in possession in each inch there of till the land is partition ed according the respective shares . Typographical error in description of land in terms of its volume in the High Court’s judgment does not carry vitiative impact inasmuch as the suit land is clearly described in the head note of the plaint as measuring 2722 Kanal 12 -Marla and the suit was decreed in accordance therewith; effects of the error do not impinge beyond the suit land .

[16] View taken by the High Court being well within the remit of law calls for no interference. Appeals fail. Dismissed. Judge Judge Islamabad 13.11.2019 Approved for reporting . Azmat /-
