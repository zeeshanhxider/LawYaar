[2] Shahid Ikram Siddiqui, ASC Date of Hearing: 15.03.2016 & 17.03 .2016 … JUDGMENT MIAN SAQIB NISAR, J. - Vide order dated 10.6.2014 a bench of this Court req uested the Hon’ble Chief Justice of Pakistan for the constitution of a larger bench in order to reconcile two apparently conflicting judgments of this Court reported as Muhammad Attique Vs.

[3] Jami Limited and others (PLD 2010 SC 993) and Mst. Asma Zafarul Ha ssan V s. M/s United Bank Ltd. and another (PLJ 1981 SC 242) (1981 SCMR 108) . 2. In order to decide this appeal, a comprehensive narration of the facts is required: - respondent No.1/bank (decree holder) filed a suit on 30.5.1994 for recovery of finances granted to respondent No.2/ customer , for whom Rana Muhammad Aslam, the predecessor -in- Civil Appeal No.280 -L/2009 - 2 - interest of respondent s No.3(i) to (vi) (judgment debtor) , stood surety having mortgaged his property bearing No.

[4] S-57-R-32-E, 5 -Temple Road, Lahore measuring approximate ly 12 marlas 86 square feet (lower portion of a double storied residential house ; hereinafter referred to as the ‘property’ ). A decree for the recovery of Rs.600,871.10/ - was passed (alongwith Rs.15,167/ - as costs) under Section 6 of the Banking Tribunals Ordinance, 1984 (1984 Ordinance) in favour of the decree holder and against the judgment debtor on 20.3.1995 which (decree ) has attained finality .

[5] Subsequently, the decree holder filed an execution petition under Section 11 of the 1984 Ordinance and a court auctioneer was appointed on 24.10.1995 to conduct the sale of the mortgaged property. In this order it is unequivocally mentioned that though Section 11(3) of the 1984 Ordinance enables a decree holder to sell mortgaged property itself without interventi on of the Banking Tribunal, but in the instant case the decree holder sought execution of the mortgaged property through the Tribunal.

[6] T he first auction was held , in which the predecessor -in- interest of the appellants, Liaqat Ali Mujahid (auction purchaser ), was the highest bidder , with a bid of Rs.226,000/ - (which was deposited by him wit h the Executing Court) . The judgment debtor filed an objection petition challenging the auction to the auction purchaser on the ground that the value of the property had b een assessed by the surveyor of the decree holder as Rs.950,000/ - at the time of provision of finance to respondent No.2.

[7] The objection petition was accepted by the Tribunal vide order dated 27.11.1996. A fresh proclamation of sale was issued , a reserve price of Rs.600,000/ - was fixed and the second auction was held on 12.1.1997 which failed. Subsequently, the auction purchaser offered to raise his bid from Rs.226,000/ - to Rs.400,000/ -.

[8] Meanwhile, the Banking Companies (Recovery of Loans, Advances, Credits and Finances) Ordinance, 1997 (1997 Ordinance) was promulgated on 4.2.1997 Civil Appeal No.280 -L/2009 - 3 - and the Banking Tribunals constituted under the 1984 Ordinance were abolished vide notification dated 11.2.1997 after which the execution petition stood transferred to the Banking Court constituted under the 1997 Ordinance as is manifest from the order dated 27.2.1997 of the newly constituted Banking Court (note: - the Ordinance of 1997 was replaced by the Banking Companies (Recovery of Loans, Advances, Credits and Finances) Act, 1997 (1997 Act) which came into force on 31.5.1997 ).

[9] On 8.5.1997 the Banking Court rejected the auction purchaser’s offer to raise his bid for the reason that his revised offer was still below the assessed value of the property and the reserve price, which (offer) was neither acceptable to the judgment debtor nor the decree holder. Through the same order, upon the request of the decree holder, the Banking Court allowed the former to sell the mortgaged property by public auction or private treaty, subject to confirmation by the court .

[10] The relevant part of the order reads as under :- “In reply to the application, the decree holder has sought permission to sell the mortgaged property itself and the law permits the same. The decree holder is, therefore, permitted to sell the mortgaged property either by way of public auction or through private treaty but the proceedings would be subject to confirmation by this court.

[11] For report of sale and filing of the sale proceedings by the decree holder now to come up on 10.6.97.” (Emphasis supplied) There are numerous dates on which the Court awaited the report of the court auctioneer for the sale of the property through auction and one of the orders even suggests that the Banking Court approved the draft Civil Appeal No.280 -L/2009 - 4 - proclamation of sale in terms of Order 21 Rule 66 of the Code of Civil Procedure, 1908 (CPC) subsequent to which the third auction took place on 7.9.1998.

[12] During the proceedings the counsel for the decree holder had been appearing but no one appeared on behalf of the judgment debtor of the case. The order dated 23.9.1998 reveals that the auction purchaser, whose previous offer of Rs.400,000/ - was not accepted by the Banking Court, when present in the Court improved his offer to the tune of Rs.6,16,038/ - which (offer) was accept ed by the decree holder.

[13] However the Court ordered: - “Now it is to be seen whether auction is to be confirmed for the above referred amount or the property is to be re -auctione d.” The Court adjourned the matter to 2.10.1998 and upon an application filed by the court auctioneer claiming fee, issued notice to the decree holder.

[14] No notice was issued to the judgment debtor. Such sale was confirmed by the Banking Court vide order dated 2.10.1998 and the file was consigned to the record room. The relevant part of the above order reads as follows: - “Whereas the auction purchaser has purchased the property mentioned in ‘Fard Taliq’ for a sum of Rs.6,16,038/ - as a result of private negotiation with the decree holder , therefore, the same is confirmed in favour of t he auction purchaser Mr.

[15] Liaqat Ali Mujahid. He be issued sale certificate on his application subject to payment of remaining price deducting 1/4th amount already deposited till 15.11.98.” (Emphasis supplied) Civil Appeal No.280 -L/2009 - 5 - On 7.12.1998 seemingly on an applicatio n by the auction purchaser, the file was resurrected and the following order was passed: - “Pursuant to my order dated 18.11.98 on the application referred to above, the file has been put up before me today.

[16] The auction purchaser Mr. Liaqat Ali Mujahid ha s sought the Sale Certificate being the highest bidder of property No.S -57-R-32 E situated at 5 -Temple Road, Lahore. The report of the Nazir shows that the purchase price of Rs.622,038/ - has been deposited by the auction purchaser in out of which Rs.616,03 8/- has been given to the decree holder bank and now remaining Rs.6000/ - are lying in this court which are to be disbursed to the judgment debtor being the excess amount from the decretal amount.

[17] Sale Certificate be issued to Mr. Liaqat Ali Mujahid the auc tion purchaser in accordance with law. File be consigned to the record room as before.” The sale certi ficate was issued on 8.12.1998 . Thereafter the auction purchaser moved an application seeking possession of the purchased property and for that purpose, a Commission was appointed by the Banking Court vide order dated 19.4.1999 and eventually the possession was delivered to the auction purchaser.

[18] The judgment debtor filed an application under Order 21 Rule 90 of the CPC on 15.4.1999 challenging the sale of the property in favour of the auction purchaser and he was directed to deposit of 20% of the sale price i.e. Rs.123,200/ - with the Banking Court before 16.7.1999 which was so done on 8.7.1999.

[19] Vide order dated 20.9.1999 the application under Order 21 Rul e 90 of the CPC filed by the judgment debtor was Civil Appeal No.280 -L/2009 - 6 - dismissed on the groun ds that (i) he had been participating in the proceedings throughout , (ii) the judgment debtor previously filed objections which were disallowed by the Banking Court , (iii) some earlier attempts were made to sell the property but none came forward except the auction purchaser , (iv) the decree holder and the auction purchaser mutually negotiated the sale of the property and as a result the decree holder agreed to the disposal of the proper ty at Rs.616,038/ - as is evident from the order dated 23.9.1998.

[20] The Banking Court finally adjudged that the property has been rightly sold through private negotiation. The plea taken up by the respondent that he was unaware of the execution proceedings wa s discarded as he was held to be participating in the proceedings; besides the property was sold on 29.3.1998, whereas the objection petition was moved on 15.4.1999 which was barred by time and no application for condonation of delay was filed.

[21] Thus the ap plication under Order 21 Rule 90 of the CPC was dismissed both on merits as also on the ground of limitation. Aggrieved of the above, the judgment debtor assailed this order in appeal and the learned Appellate Court whilst accepting the same (appeal) came to the conclusion that once having resorted to sell ing the property through public auction as per the provisions of Order 21 of the CPC, the same could not be sold through private negotiation and thus the Banking Court had committed an illegality.

[22] Thereaft er, the auction purchaser filed an appeal before this Court which has culminated into the instant opinion. 3. Learned counsel for the appellants by relying upon the judgments reported as Muhammad Attique (supra) and Asma Zafarul Hassan (supra) argued tha t there is no bar upon the Executing Court against selling the property through private treaty/negotiation.

[23] He submitted that initially the auction procedure for the purposes of sale of Civil Appeal No.280 -L/2009 - 7 - the property as envisaged by Order 21, CPC was adopted, but due to numerous failed attempts, the Banking Court was authorized to permit sale to take place through private treaty between the decree holder and the auction purchaser and to subsequently confirm such sale.

[24] He submitted that the view set out by the learned High Co urt that the sale could not be made otherwise than in accordance with Order 21, CPC is violative of the judgments cited above, and since the decree was passed prior to enactment of the 1997 Act therefore its execution would be governed by the 1984 Act , Sec tion 11(3) whereof allowed for sale by private treaty; and if it is the 1997 Act which is to govern the execution process, even then sale by private treaty is permissible under the law as the same is amply covered by the phrase “in such other manner as the Banking Court may deem fit” as set out in Section 18(1) of the said Act.

[25] Learned counsel submitted that there was conscious application of mind by the learned Tribunal , as no bidders came forth as a result of which the numerous attempts at auction failed, it was well within the jurisdiction of the Tribunal and in the interest s of justice to allow for sale by private treaty.

[26] He further argued that the judgment debtor had participat ed in the execution proceedings throughout and was well aware that the proper ty could not be sold through auction . When the auction purchaser moved an application to the Court seeking permission for sale of the property through private negotiation, the judgment debtor was not required to be issued any notice, rather it was a matter between the decree holder and the auction purchaser on the one hand and the learned Executing Court on the other.

[27] He also contended that the objection petition was filed beyond the period of thirty days and was thus rightly discarded by the learned Court as being barred by time. Civil Appeal No.280 -L/2009 - 8 - 4. Conversely, learned counsel for the respondent s has led us to various orders of the Banking Tribunal /Court and argued that no notice had been issued to the judgment debtor whose property was to be sold through private treaty, rather a notice was issued to the decree holder when the auction purchaser applied for sale of the property through private treaty.

[28] In this manner the judgment debtor had been condemned unheard and therefore the entire process of the private sale in favou r of the auction purchaser stands vitiated. He also submitted that once the process and proc edure of auction under the CPC w as resorted to for the disposal of a mortgaged property thereafter the Court did not have the jurisdiction to deviate therefrom and take a different course.

[29] Reliance in this regard has been placed on the cases reported as Muhammad Rafiq Vs. United Bank Limited and another (2005 CLD 1162) , National Bank of Pakistan and 117 others Vs. SAF Textile Mills Ltd. and another (PLD 2014 SC 283) and Muhammad Attique (supra) . 5. Heard. The propositions which have emerged for the purposes of the present appeal are: - (i) What was the law applicable on 8.5.1997, 23.9.1998 and 2.10.1998, when the Banking Court allowed the property to be sold by the bank through private treaty, the offer of the appellant was accepted by the bank and the confirmation of the private sale in favour of the appellant respectively, and what is the effect of such law on the facts and circumstances of the present case; (ii) Whether th e order dated 8.5.1997 passed by the Banking Tribunal was superseded by the Banking Court vide its order dated 10.6.1997 and if so, to what effect; (iii) Whether under the 1984 Ordinance or the 1997 Ordinance/Act both being special law s, the Banking Civil Appeal No.280 -L/2009 - 9 - Tribunal/Co urt in execution proceedings, could adopt any procedure it deem ed fit for the sale of the mortgaged property other than the one (the procedure) prescribed b y the two laws mentioned above; (iv) Having once adopted a mode of execution as set out in the CPC, can a court deviate therefrom; (v) With respect to the merits of the case, does the sale achieve validity on the touchston e of either of the special laws; (vi) To reconcile the two apparently conflicting judgments of this Court identified in paragraph No.1 of this op inion, i.e.

[38] Repeal. – (1) The Banking Companies (Recovery of Loans) Ordinance, 1979 (XIX of 1979), the Banking Tribunals Ordinance, 1984 (LVIII of 1984), and the Banking Companies (Recovery of Loans, Advances, Credits and Finances) Ordinance, 1997 (XXV of 1997), are hereby repealed. (2) ………………………………………… ……” 6. With respect to the first proposition we may reiterate the following: a decree for the recovery of a certain amount was passed in this case under Section 6 of the 1984 Ordinance and an execution petition was filed under Section 11 of the said Ordinance.

[39] During the pendency of the execution proceedings, the 1997 Ordinance was promulgated on 4.2.1997 and the Banking Tribunals constituted under the 1984 Ordinance were abolished vide notification dated 11.2.1997 after which the execution petition stood transferred to the Banking Court constituted under the 1997 Ordinance.

[40] The 1997 Ordinance was replaced by the 1997 Act which (Act) came into force on 31.5.1997. The 1997 Ordinance was promulgated on 4.2.1997 and by virtue of Article 89(2)(a)(ii) of the Co nstitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (the Constitution) , it was to stand repealed at the expiration of 120 days of its promulgation, i.e. on 3.6.1997.

[41] However before the expiry of 120 days, the 1997 Ordinance was laid before Parliament unde r Article 89(3)(b) of the Constitution and culminated into the 1997 Act which was promulgated on 31.5.1997, i.e. the day it received the President’s Civil Appeal No.280 -L/2009 - 16 - assent. The 1997 Act repealed the 1997 and 1984 Ordinances (the latter of which already stood repealed unde r the 1997 Ordinance) . 7.

[42] Accordingly, the 1984 Ordinance stood irrevocably repealed on 4.2.1997 by virtue of the 1997 Ordinance, ergo for all legal intents and purposes, the 1984 Ordinance ceased to have effect on the said date. The fact that there was no saving clause in the 1997 Ordinance (and none in the 1997 Act either) to the effect that all proceedings, rights or liabilities under the 1984 Ordinance would continue to be governed by the latter ordinance lends credence to this interpretation.

[43] Instead there was only a transfer provision in the form of Section 7(6) of the 1997 Ordinance (and the 1997 Act) , providing that a ll proceedings, including proceedings for the execution of a decree within the jurisdiction of a Banking Court, pending in any Bankin g Tribunal constituted under the 1984 Ordinance (and the 1997 Ordinance) shall stand transferred to the Banking Court having jurisdiction under the 1997 Ordinance (and the 1997 Act) . 8.

[44] In any event, it is indeed settled law , in line with Section 6 of the General Clauses Act, 1897 , that any act done or any action taken or purported to have been done or taken under or in pursuance of the repealed Act, shall in so far as it is not inconsistent with the provisions of new Act, be deemed to have been done or t aken under the corresponding provisions of the new Act.

[45] A litigant is provide d protection with respect to any right, privilege, obligation or liability acquired or accrued under any enactment repealed. Substantive laws are only very exceptionally amended w ith retrospective effect for the eminently sensible reason that one does not change the goal posts mid - game .

[46] Unless a Legislature enacts a new law (the 1997 Act ) to be specifically retrospective , and that too with great particularity of language, the Court s are not to assume retrospectivity. There is nothing Civil Appeal No.280 -L/2009 - 17 - in the repealing section , i.e. Section 28 of the 1997 Act, to indicate that the Legislature meant for such Act to be applied with retrospective effect.

[47] Therefore the question of retrospective applicatio n of the provisions of the 1997 Ordinance (and the 1997 Act) does not arise, as the execution proceedings in the case at hand, though instituted under the 1984 Ordinance, stood transferred to the Banking Court established under the 1997 Ordinance and then the 1997 Act, and in the absence of any saving clause as mentioned above, the relevant provisions of the 1997 Ordinance (and then the 1997 Act) were to apply on the date of transfer of such proceedings and thereafter.

[48] The Banking Court is not required to proceed de novo , rather from the stage which the proceedings had reached immediately prior to the transfer as envisaged by Section 7(7) of the 1997 Act (reproduced hereinabove) . 9. Section 12 of the 1997 Ordinance dealt with execution of decrees and provi ded that where a banking company is a mortgagee of any property belonging to the judgment -debtor, the banking company may sell such property without the intervention of the Banking Court either by public auction or by private treaty to any person or purcha se such property on its own account.

[49] Further, where the banking company wishe d to sell the property by private treaty or to purchase it on its own account it was to , before concluding the sale , give to the judgment debtor an option by a notice in writing f or purchasing or redeeming such property at the price at which the banking company propose d to sell or purchase within such period as the banking company may specify in such notice which was not, in any case, to be less than seven days.

[50] Therefore the 1997 Ordinance clearly permitted for sale by way of private treaty, subject to the written notice of option to purchase being provided to the judgment debtor. However these provisions only came into effect from the date of promulgation of the 1997 Ordinance til l its Civil Appeal No.280 -L/2009 - 18 - repeal, i.e. from 4.2.1997 to 31.5.1997, after which the relevant provisions of the 1997 Act came in to force.

[51] The provisions governing execution of decree under the 1997 Act were contained in Section 18, which provide d that in cases of mortgaged prop erty a banking company could sell the same with or without the intervention of the Banking Court by inviting sealed tenders in which case the banking company was to invite offers through advertisements in one English and one Urdu newspaper having a wide ci rculation in the city in which the sale was to take place giving not less than thirty days’ time for submi ssion of offers, provided that before conclu sion of the sale the judgment -debtor was to be given an opportunity to purchase the property at a matching price to be paid in cash within a period of thirty days.

[52] There was a clear departure in the wording of Section 18 of the 1997 Act from that of Section 12 of the 1997 Ordinance, the former allowing a banking company to sell the mortgaged property by sealed tenders, and the latter by private treaty, thereby implying that sale by private treaty was no longer permissible under the 1997 Act.

[53] This was the situation prevailing from 31.5.1997 onwards, and this is indubitably the reason that the Banking Court on 10.6.1997 passed an order to the effect that “…For report of sale by auction or inviting tenders of the mortgaged property by the decree holder…” , and not “sale by auction or private treaty” .

[54] This distinction needs to be appreciated and it is the reason why the subsequent order of the Banking Court allowing the sale by private negotiation/treaty (and the issuance of the sale certificate ) is violati ve of the law that existed at the relevant point of time. Notwithstanding the above stated legal position, the sa le was even otherwise illegal on the touchstone of the 1984 Ordinance.

[55] Section 11(3) of the 1984 Ordinance required the bank (decree holder) in case of sale through private negotiation to give to the judgment debtor, by a notice, Civil Appeal No.280 -L/2009 - 19 - the option to purchase or redeem the property , as the case may be, at the same price within such time as the banking company may supply in such notice, but this option, a right conferred upon the judgment - debtor , was never afforded to him.

[56] Therefore, the sale was not made as per th e law and cannot be sustain ed even by virtue of the repealed 1984 Ordinance. It is settled that where law requires an act to be done in a particular manner it has to be done in that manner alone and such dictate of law cannot be termed a mere technicality. 10.

[57] In the case of Asma Zafarul Hassan (supra) leave was refused to challenge the order of the Sindh High Court whereby the court dismissed an application for setting aside a sale of property in execution proceedings. T he relevant facts are that after tw o attempts to sell the property through public auction failed, the court allowed the sale through private offer arranged through the Nazir’s personal efforts .

[58] It must be kept in mind that these events occurred during 1977 i .e. before the promulgation of sp ecial banking laws and hence the relevant provisions of the CPC would have been applicable . Through the leave refusing order this Court, inter alia, held that the High Court gave its “tacit consent ” to the “private offer ” mode of sale and by ineluctable inference that it was not necessary to pass a specific order to this effect and further that unless a procedure was specifically barred it may be adopted by the court for serving the ends of justice.

[59] This finding is not in consonance with that of Muhammad At tique ’s case (supra) wherein this Court upheld the order of the Lahore High Court remanding the challenge/objections to the auction of a property in execution proceedings to the Banking Court for decision afresh. The sale of the property in question had be en effected through a purportedly flawed public auction.

[60] For our purposes the relevant finding of this Court was that the provisions of the Financial Institution (Recovery of Finances) Civil Appeal No.280 -L/2009 - 20 - Ordinance 2001 (FIO 2001) allow the Executing Court to choose the mode of execution in accordance with the CPC or any other law in force but “once it has chosen the mode as provided in the Civil Procedure Code, then it cannot be permitted to divert that mode at subsequent stage without conscious application of mind ” (emphasis supplied) .

[61] The conundrum before us is this; is the Executing Court simply required to give its “tacit consent” to a new/different mode of sale or must it do so through “conscious application of mind”? 11. In execution proceedings t he court of law must a lways proceed to employ the principles of balancing and proportionality in order to accomplish a state of affairs where the rights of both the decree -holder and those of the judgment debtor are secured.

[62] In the same manner the court must be conscious of pro tecting a third party such as the auction purchaser. Proportionality1 analysis involves different steps, each involving a test. First, in the “legitimacy” stage, the Court confirms that the action has been taken by a person authorized to do so . The second phase – “suitability” – is devoted to judicial verification that, with respect to the act in question, the means adopted are rationally related to stated objectives.

[63] The third step, called “necessity,” is to ensure that the measure does not curtail the rig ht of a party any more than is necessary for achieve ment of stated goals . The last stage, “balancing in the strict sense,” requires that the court weighs the benefits of the act against the costs incurred by infringement of the right, in order to determine which right shall prevail, in light of the respective importance of the values in tension, given the facts.

[64] The principles of proportionality outlined above are increasingly defining jurisprudence across the globe. For our purposes t he court is to achieve the purpose of the execution 1 Essay , March 2008 , Proportion ality Balancing and Global Constitutionalism by Alec Stone Sweet, Yale Law S chool and Jud Mathews , Yale Law School.

[65] Civil Appeal No.280 -L/2009 - 21 - viz. the recovery of money owed to the decree holder through sale of the judgment debtor’s property ; to this end the court holds the rights of every litigant equally dear. The ideal manner of sale of the judgment debtor’s prop erty is indeed through public auction and the open manner in which this may be effected has been aptly defined in Lanvin Traders, Karachi Vs.

[66] Presiding Officer, Banking Court No.2 (2013 SCMR 1419 ) per our learned brother, Justice Anwar Zaheer Jamali . But s ale(s) of property in execution proceedings are essentially distress sales and the circumstances are far from ideal. Therefore the legislature in its wisdom has allowed alternative means of sale.

[67] The court may depart from a preferred mode of sale if the ci rcumstances warrant such departure. But when it does depart therefrom it must be through a conscious application of mind because it must itself be convinced that a less “ideal” mode of sale is necessitated by the circumstances prevailing and these must be set out in order to reassure all the parties that the sale proceedings are open and transparent and the court is conscious of its solemn duty.

[68] Tacit consent would not meet the standard of openness required of the executing court. It is its reasons for so d oing (adopting an alternative method) which shall inspire confidence. 12. In the case reported at National Bank of Pakistan Vs. Paradise Trading Company (2015 CLD 366 ) this Court has held that, “Now it is admitted fact that in execution proceeding the Banking Tribunal has adopted the procedure of selling of the mortgage property by public auction.

[69] Once such procedure for selling the mortgage property through public auction is adopted by the Banking Tribunal then no other mode or procedure is permissibl e for selling of mortgage property except by public auction”. Civil Appeal No.280 -L/2009 - 22 - With the greatest of respect we are constrained to state that the aforesaid judgment is per incuriam and not good law for the reason that the court was not assisted properly and appears not to have considered Muhammad Attique ’s case (supra) which lays down the correct law i .e. the executing court may indeed adopt a different method of sale if required, the only proviso being that such change in course must be after due application of mind by ass igning justifiable reasons .

[70] To hold otherwise is to shackle the court in an undesirable manner and hold it hostage to its own earlier orders . 13. Our attention has been drawn to a recent judgment of this Court cited at Zakaria Ghani Vs. M. Ikhlaq Memon (PLD 2016 SC 229) in support of the proposition that the executing court may adopt a different method of sale without a specific order to this effect.

[71] The said judgment is authored by myself and I have given anxious consideration to the aforesaid propositio n and whether the said judgment indeed supports such a rendering of law. The question before this Court in the said case was not whether or not an executing court was to adopt a different method of sale after due application of mind (or otherwise) but the more fundamental question of whether or not the court could change the course or mode adopted at all? It was this latter question that the court answered in the affirmative through the said judgment by holding that, “…………This finding is also sufficient to dispose of the accompanying submission which was to the effect that once an order has been passed stipulating that the sale is to be made under the CPC it is not open to the court to switch over to any alternative procedure.

[72] Although the correctness of th is assertion is Civil Appeal No.280 -L/2009 - 23 - even otherwise doubtful in view of the case law including several judgments by this court, to which reference is made in a subsequent part herein, the contention is ill founded on a factual plane.” (Emphasis supplied) Hence this judgment d oes not stand in the way of our present finding which is that an executing court may change the mode of sale after due application of mind and giving reasons as mentioned above ; the manner in which it was to adopt a new course was a moot point in the said judgment. 14.

[73] The answers to the questions devised in the earlier part of this opinion can thus be summarized as follows : (i) The law applicable on 8.5.1997, 23.9.1998 and 2.10.1998, (when the Banking Court allowed the property to be sold by the bank through private treaty, the offer of the appellant was accepted by the bank and the confirmation of the private sale in favour of the appellant respectively ) was the 1997 Ordinance on the first of said dates and thereafter the 1997 Act ; (ii) The order dated 8.5.1997 passed by the Banking Tribunal was not superseded by the Banking Court vide its order dated 10.6.1997 for the reason that the latter order was illegal for the reasons outlined in the earlier part of this opinion ; (iii) Under the 1984 Ordinance or the 1997 Ordin ance/Act both being special laws, the Banking Tribunal/Court in execution proceedings could adopt any procedure it deemed fit for the sale of the mortgaged property other than the one (the procedure) prescribed by the said two laws; Civil Appeal No.280 -L/2009 - 24 - (iv) Having once adopted a mode of execution as set out in the CPC, an executing court can deviate therefrom with due application of mind and upon assigning justifiable reasons ; (v) The sale was even otherwise illegal on the touchstone of either of the special laws ; (vi) The correct law ha s been laid down in the case of Muhammad Attique (supra) and the judgment delivered in Asma Zafarul Hassan (supra) is not the correct law.

[74] In light of the above, subject to the reasons assigned in this opinion while upholding the impugned judgment, thi s appeal is dismissed with the consequence that the private sale made in favour of the auction purchaser (predecessor -in-interest of the appellants) as confirmed by the Banking Court stands set aside.

[75] However, keeping in view the peculiar facts and circums tances of the case, particularly that the auction purchaser has paid an amount of Rs.6,16,038/ - as sale consideration which amount has been received (wholly or partly) by the decree holder in satisfaction of its decree and has no further claim in this beh alf; and as the real contest is between the appellants and the judgment debtor, thus in order to safeguard the interest of both the parties and keeping in view the rule of justice, equity and fairplay we direct that the property in question should be put t o open auction and out of the sale proceeds the appellants should be returned the amount paid by them to the decree holder (or any further amount if deposited in the court after satisfying the decree) along with 10 percent yearly profit (note: - not on comp ound basis ) as compensation on such amount; besides the appellants should be refunded the amount of utility bills paid by them (subject to Civil Appeal No.280 -L/2009 - 25 - proof) along with the profit at the rate mentioned above and the balance amount should be given to the judgment debto r/respondent No.3.
