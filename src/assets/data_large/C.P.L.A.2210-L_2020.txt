(In all cases) C.P.2210 -L of 2020, etc . 2 Date of hearing: 25.03.2021 JUDGMENT Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, J. - The question before us is whether the date of regularization of contract employees is the date of their initial appointment on contract basis or the date of their regularization under the Regularization Policy dated 10.11.2010 ? 2.

[7] The background to the above question is that the respondents were appointed on contract basis as Veterinary Officers in Grade -17 in Livestock & Dairy Development Department, Government of the Punjab during the years 2004 to 2009. Their services were subsequently regularized by the Government with immedia te effect , vide order dated 15.2.2011.

[8] The grievance of the respondents was that they ought to have been regularized from the date of their initial appointment on contractual basis rather than on 15.2.2011 i.e., the date of regularization of their service. Their representation and departmental appeal were turned down on 21.07.2018 and 29.01.2020.

[9] However, on approaching the Punjab Service Tribunal (“Tribunal ”), the appeals of the respondents were allowed vide impugned order dated 14.10.2020, allowing regula rization of the services with effect from the date of their initial appointment on contract basis. The said order has been impugned before us by the Provincial Government. 3.

[10] Learned counsel submits that the respondents are not entitled to regularization from the date of their initial appointment for the reason that they have no vested right to regular appointment. There is no clause in their Letters of Appointment or the Contract Employment Policy dated 29.12.2004 (“Contract Policy ”) that confers such a right.

[11] The Policy regarding Appointment of Contractees in BS -16 and above on Regular Basis dated 10.11.2010 (“ Regularization Policy ”) allows for regularization but does not permit its retrospective application. He submits that there is no legal justification whatsoever for giving effect to their regularization retrospectively and has placed reliance upon the judgment of a five member Bench of this Court dated 29.1.2018, passed in Civil Review Petition No. and C.P.2210 -L of 2020, etc . 3 unreported judgme nts dated 13.03.2010 passed in CP no. 318 -L to 330-L of 2018 & dated 21.07.2020 passed in CP nos. 194 -L/2020, etc. 4.

[12] Learned counsel for the respondents , on the other hand, referred to the Contr act Policy and submitted that there are two streams of appointment in the Provincial Government; one is that of regular appointment and the other of contractual appointment. He submits that the mode and the manner of appointment in both the schemes is the same, therefore, at any stage if the Government decides to regularize the services of contractual employees, they are to be regularized from the date of their initial appointment, as there is no material difference between the two sets of appointments as far as the qualification and process of appointment is c oncerned. 5.

[13] In order to appreciate the contentions of the parties it is important to understand the scheme of contractual and regular appointment under the Provincial Government. The Contract Appointment Policy was conceived after the Government realiz ed that regular mode of appointment is not suitable for most of the Government sector assignments due to administrative and financial factors1.

[14] The rationale behind the contractual mode of appointment is based on financial and economic reasons, as well as, a dministrative reasons. According to the Policy2, the financial constraints of salary and pension under regular appointment had become unsustainable. Besides several administrative reasons associated with the regular employees also tilted the scales in favour of the contractual mode of appointment: large scale absenteeism of regular employees; poor performance leading to poor service delivery ; cumbersome accountability mechanism systems; huge administrative costs of transfer and promotions , etc; no concept of performance based indicators; contract mode being more flexible to tap in the best human resource available in the market; latest management practices in the developed world also recommend ed contract mode of appointment.

[15] These reasons led to development of two separate scheme s of appointment. Persons 1 Contract Appointment Policy dated 29.12.2004. 2 Clause 11 of the Contract Policy. C.P.2210 -L of 2020, etc . 4 appointed on contract basis are not civil servants, therefore, their service matters are not governed by the rules framed under Civil Servants Act, 1974.

[16] Their appointment is strictly regu lated by the terms and conditions of the contract3. Their period of contract is between 3 to 5 years4 and extension is generally granted for a period of 3 to 5 years and not for an indefinite period.5 On expiry of contract appointment, if no extension is granted, it is ensured that the contract employee is not allowed to continue in service6.

[17] Contract appointment is liable to be terminated on one month’s notice or on one month’s pay, in lieu thereof, o n either side without assigning any reason7. The contract provides that the contract appointment shall not confer any right of regular appointment nor shall such appointment be regularized under any circumstances8.

[18] A contract employee shall, under no circu mstances, claim conversion of his contract appoi ntment into regular appointment9. 6. On the other hand, e mployees appointed o n regular basis are governed by the rules framed u nder the Punjab Civil Servants Act, 1974 such as the Punjab C ivil Servants (Appointment & Conditions of Service) Rules, 1974, Service Rules of the post, Leave Rules, Pension Rules, etc.10.

[19] The above shows that a contractual employee is appointed under a scheme, which is totally different from that of regular appointment and a contractual appointee does not enjoy the right to be appointed on regular basis or to be readily shifted into the regime of regular appointment. It does not matter i f the appointment on contract is through the same process of public advertisement an d scrutiny through Punjab Public Service Commission , it is still a contractual appointment for a limited period of time and is different from a regular appointment by virtue of which a person attains the status of a civil servant.

[20] This distinction between the two streams of services is importa nt to address the question posed at the beginning of this judgment. 3 Clause VI (vii) ibid 4 Clause XIV (i) ibid 5 Clause XIV(vi) ibid 6 Clause XIV (ix) ibid 7 Clause XVII(i) ibid 8 Guidelines for Fixing Terms and Conditions of Contra ct Appointments (Annexure B to the Contract Appointment Policy 29.12.2004) Para 11 9 Clause -XII(vi) Contract Policy. 10 Clause V(iv) ibid C.P.2210 -L of 2020, etc . 5 7.

[21] The scheme of regularization is unnecessary for a civil servant (a regular employee) and has been introduced only to induct the contractual emplo yees into regular service. The Regularization Policy provides for a special procedure whereby the cases of the contractual employees are considered for regularization on a case -to-case basis, keeping in view their performance and other qualifications.

[22] Regularization of a contract employee is , therefore, a fresh appointment into the stream of regular appointment. A contractual employee for the first time becomes a civil servant. It is underlined that contractual employees enjoy no vested right to regularization (see Contract Appointment Policy) much less to be regularized from any particular date.

[23] The benefit of regularization extended to them under the Regularization Policy is prospective in nature and there is no legal j ustification to give it a retrospective application. Any such step would totally negate the purpose and significance of Contract Appointment Policy and leave no distinction between a contractual and a regular employ ee.

[24] This has been the tenor of the jurisp rudence evolved by this court and reference can be made to judgment of a five member Bench of this Court dated 29.1.2018, passed in Civil Review Petition No. and unreported judgments dated 13.03.2010 passed in CP no. 318 -L to 330 -L of 2018 & dated 21.07.2020 passed in CP nos. 194 -L/2020, etc.

[25] It is also important to underline that t he consistent governmental policies on regularization have finally manifested themselves in the Punjab Regularization of Service Act, 20 18 ("Act") which specifically prov ides for regularization from immediate effect. Therefore, there has been a consistent design behind the scheme of regularization and it has always been conceived from the date of regularization.

[26] We see no reason to upset this uniform governmental policy w hich has now received legislative support under the Act. 8. For the above reasons, we convert these petitions into appeals and allow the same; the impugned consolidated order of the Tribunal is set aside, and the respondents shall stand regularized w.e.f. 15.2.2011 i.e, the date of regularization.
