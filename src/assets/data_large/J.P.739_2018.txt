Ehtisham -ul-Haq, Special Prosecutors, ANF Date of hearing: 13.04.2021 ORDER Qazi Muhammad Amin Ahmed, J. - On a tip off , the petitioner s were intercepted by Anti -Narcotic Force contingent Jail Petition No.739 of 2018 and Criminal Petition No.1344 and 1351 of 2018 2 within the precincts of Police Station Rawat at :00 on 10.10.2016 ; they were transporting a heavy consignment of narcotics concealed in different portions of a car ; the search led to discovery of ten packets of contraband , wei ghing 10 -kg, surreptitiously placed in different cavities , forensically confirmed as cannabis; they were indicted by the learned Special Judge (CNS) Islamabad who returned them a guilty verdict under Section 9(c) of the Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997; sentenced to ten years rigorous imprisonment , they were directed to pay Rs.100,000/ - each as fine or to undergo nine months simple imprisonment in lieu thereof, vide judgment dated 19.04.2018 ; their appeal failed before a learned Division Bench of th e Islamabad High Court vide impugned judgment dated 10.10.2018, vires whereof, are being assailed on a variety of grounds ranging from false implication , discrepant statements of the witnesses , non-availability of support from the public and a forensic rep ort with deficient protocols .

[3] The learned Law Officer faithfully defended the impugned judgment, according to him, the prosecution succeeded in proving the charge to the hilt beyond a shadow of doubt . 2. Heard. Record perused. 3. We have gone through th e evidence to find the witnesses in a substantial unison on all the details of the episode; petitioners’ joint arrest with the vehicle they were travelling in and seizure of contraband therefrom are circumstances heavily looming over their culpability.

[4] Fo rensic report substantially details the procedure adopted by the analyst to undertake the analysis , unambiguously confirming the narcotic character of the contraband , a conclusion that went unrebutted/unchallenged during the trial . Petitioners’ different b ackgrounds, converging in their illicit pursuit , the only common ground, by itself confirms a collaboration in a purpose far from being usual or just.

[5] Inconsequential cross -examination and reticent denial s, in retrospect, lend a mute support to the prosecu tion in its quest to drive home the charge . In the totality of circumstances, we are not persuaded to take a view other than the one concurrently taken by the Courts below. However, distinctly saddled with different quantities of the contraband by each con vict, ranging from Jail Petition No.739 of 2018 and Criminal Petition No.1344 and 1351 of 2018 3 2 to 5 k.g. , a case set up by the prosecution itself , spells out a makeshift union instead of a concerted joint detour , therefore, we are inclined to proportionately mould the sentence .

[6] Consequently, while maintaining their convictio n, sentence awarded to them is reduced to a period of 5 -years R.I. with a corresponding reduction in the fine to the tune of Rs.50,000/ - each with 6-months S.I. in the event of default , a wage conscionable in the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case .

[7] With the aforesaid modification, the petitions are converted into appeal and partly allowed. Judge Judge Judge Islamabad 13th April, 2021 Not approved for reporting. Azmat /*
