[1] order dated 04.02.2025 passed in C.R.No.342 of 2022 with CM No.1069 of 2022 by Peshawar High Court, Peshawar) Hidayat Khan and others … Petitioner(s) Versus Mst. Nasreen and others … Respondent(s) For the Petitioner(s): Mr. Manzoor Khan Khalil, ASC For Respondent: N.R. Date of Hearing: 24.04.2025 O R D E R SHAHID BILAL HASSAN, J .

[2] Seeking indulgence of this Court while granting leave to appeal against th e order dated 04.02.2025 passed in C.R.No.342 of 2022 by the Peshawar High Court, Peshawar, the petitioner(s) have brought the instant petition under Article 185(3) of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973, 2.

[3] Facts, in concision, leading to filing of the instant petition are as such that the petitioner(s) instituted a suit for declaration of title germane to the disputed property , fully detailed in the plaint, on the strength of a gift deed dated 02.10.1988, purportedly executed by their predecessor in interest namely Dawai Khan and they further sought declaration of invalidity against the inheritance mutation of Dawai Khan and the inheritance mutation No.7030 by Madad Khan in favour of Mst.

[4] Nasrin Begum , whi ch was stated to have been attested on 21.01.2014. The suit was contested by the defendant Madad Khan, whereas the remaining respondents/ defendants conceded the claim of the petitioner(s) by filing their respective conceding written statements. Divergenc e in pleadings of the parties was summed up into issues and both the contesting parties adduced and produced their evidence in pro and contra.

[5] On conclusion of trial, the trial Court vide judgment and decree dated 31.01.2019 dismissed suit of the petitione r(s), which was assailed by C.P.L.A.No.287 -P of 2025 2 preferring an appeal but the same resulted in dismissal vide judgment and decree dated 03.01.2022 and this scenario led the petitioner(s) to file revision petition before the High Court but to no avail in their favour as the same was dismissed, too through the order impugned before us. 3.

[6] Heard at length and record has been gone through. 4. It is an irony that despite being a Muslim Society, we have , out of greed, shunned the teachings of Islam especially in respect of matters of inheritance involving property/land of the deceased propositus and such designs are achieved by using a tactic as to gift, tamleek by the deceased propositus .

[7] When such situation arises and a person knocks the door of the Court in order to get his/her lawful right(s)/share from the legacy of propositus, the Court(s) have to ponder upon and plunge deep into the fact s of the case, so as to fetch the truth by evaluating and scrutinizing evidence of the parties.

[8] As such, when such a transaction is put under challenge, the following principles are to be fulfilled and considered: a) Beneficiary of the impugned transaction of gift/transfer of immovable property(s) bears the heavy onus to prove the transaction1; b) The beneficiary of a gift has to plead and prove three mandatory ingredients of gift i.e. declaration/offer by the donor, acceptance of gift by the donee and delivery of possession in pursuance of the gift2; c) The possession of immovable property by one of the siblings/L .Rs. to the exclusion of other legal representatives will be treated as constructive possession on behalf of all others unless proved otherwise3; 1 Muhammad Sarwar v.

Mehboob Alam (2015 C.P.L.A.No.287 -P of 2025 4 h) Mere efflux of time does not extinguish the right of inheritance, therefore , the question of limitation in case of inheritance and fraud is not attracted and becomes insignificant8.

[24] Now, when facts of the instant case are weighed on the touchstone of the principles settled by this Court in the precedents developed from decades with the evolution, it can safely be concluded and observed that the gift in the case in hand was conditional because the possession was not deliver ed to the petitioner(s) rather it is evident from the recital of the gift deed that the donor would retain the possession during his lifetime, meaning thereby one of the ingredient(s) of a valid gift was missing and w hen a document creates a future obligation(s) or right(s), it has to be compulsorily registered and when position remains otherwise, as in the present case, such document does not consider any right(s) in view of command of section 49 of the Registration A ct, 1918 read with section 123 of the Transfer of Property Act, 1882; therefore, the learned High Court has rightly construed law on the subject in this regard.

[25] Moreso, when such a document, creating future obligation(s) and right(s) is executed, the same, when challenged, requires to be proved by producing two marginal witnesses as per mandate of Article 79 of the Qanun -e- Shahadat Order, 1984, which is lacking in this case as none of them was produced and the witnesses produced in the witness box for ident ification of their signature(s) were not sought to be produced as SCMR 21); Messrs Essa Engineering Company Pvt.

Ghulam Sarwar Naqvi (PLD 1990 Supreme Court 1) C.P.L.A.No.287 -P of 2025 5 secondary evidence by moving an application disclosing the incapability, inability or death of the marginal witnesses; therefore, this aspect of the case has also rightly been considered and pondered upon by the three Courts below, concurrently.

[32] Additional ly, the scribe of the purported gift deed was also not brought into the witness box and the grandson of the scribe, who was produced as P.W.2, categorically admitted that his father was alive but being immediate successor of the scribe, he did not appear i n the witness box and even the register maintained by the scribe was not brought on record through proper custody.

[33] All this establishes that the petitioner(s) could not prove their case by leading unimpeachable, confidence inspiring and strong evidence qua the purported gift deed. 5. More and above, the petitioner(s) could not plead and prove as to which were the circumstances and incidents that the propositus despite being a Muslim proceeded to deprive his legal heirs/sons and gifted out his property to the present petitioner(s)/gr andsons/sons of Murad Khan.

[34] Pleading and proving of such facts was necessary and sine qua non, which are missing in the instant case. 6. The compendium of the above is that concurrent findings of the facts recorded by the trial Court and appellate Court and upheld by the High Court while rendering the impugned order ( refusing to make interference in exercise of revisional jurisdiction under section 115, Code of Civil Procedure, 19089) are not open to any interference by us.

[35] Therefore, no case of grant of leave is made out, consequent whereof the leave is refused and petition in hand stands dismissed.
