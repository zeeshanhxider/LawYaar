Jail Petition No.594 of 2018, filed by Khan Muhammad is barred by 35 days , however, since the petitioner is in receipt of a guilty verdict with corporal consequences , we consider it expedient to attend his plea on merit alongside Jail Petiti on No.480 of 2018 filed by his co-convict Abdul Wahab . 2.

[5] Heard. Record perused. 3. Prosecution case is , primarily , structured upon statements of Izhar Ali Shah, ASI (PW -1), Muhammad Ayub (PW-2) and Abdul Haq, Inspector (PW-4); we have gone through their statements and found them in a comfortable unison, despit e flux of time, on all the salient aspects of the prosecution case, in terms of interception of the petitioners and recovery of contraband , they are consistent, straightforward and confidence inspiring and their statements cannot be discarded merely on account of absence of a witness from the public; people seldom come forward to perform their civic responsibilities and official witnesses are no less credible or trustworthy provided their statements rang true, as is the case in hand .

[6] Learned counsel for the petitioners , despite being at his best , has not been able to point out any serious flaw or infirmity that may be viewed as material or substantial in nature in the statements of the prosecution witnesses. Much stress laid by the learned counsel on a ty pographical error is not of much consequence, as the correct volume of contraband was put to the petitioners in the charge.
