[1] ORDER Jawwad S. Khawaja, J: - On 25.11 .2011 the Supreme Court vide judgment in Constitution Petition No.  directed the National Accountability Bureau (NAB) to probe into a number of matters. These matters were listed in para 57 of our judgment of 25.11.2011 and are reproduced as under: - “(5) that the National Accountability Bureau (‘NAB’) shall probe into and prepare a report on the following matters: - (a) the serious allegations enumerated in the Constitution Petition including those enumerated in paragraph 15 thereof; (b) the condu ct of state functionaries who were engaged in the process of selection of the respondent as Chairman, OGRA and their possible culpability for mal feasance, non feasance and other wrong doing; (c) the misuse of public office and the involvement of holders of public office in corruption or corrupt practices in terms of the National Accountability Ordinance; (6) the Chairman, NAB shall proceed in the matter with the promptness and diligence required in the matter; CMA  in CRP  2 (7) the report of NAB shall be submitted in Court within 45 days from today; (8) the matter be placed before us after 45 days for such further orders as may be considered appropriate, The events which followed the above judgment, as appearing from the record and from reports submitted by NAB show prima facie, that there may have been interference in proceedings before this Court and possible culpability of some persons in terms inter alia of Chapter s XI and IX, PPC and other statutes relating to Public Justice.

[2] This, prima facie, undermines the ru le of law and the legal imperative of stamping out corruption and corrupt practices. It thus, raises a concern which requires serious consideration. 2. On 01.02.2012 i.e. more than 2 months after our judgment and our direction that a report be submitted i n 45 days, the Chairman NAB authorized an investigation in the matter.

[3] Our record presently does not show as to why our order dire cting the filing of a report within 45 days, was not compiled with. The Chairman NAB appears to have authorized an invest igati on but the name of any investigation officer (I.O) was not indicated. On 28.02.2012 Mr. Ilyas Qamar and Lt. Col (r) Ikramullah were jointly appointed for the purpose.

[4] On 16.03.2012 the case was transferred to Mr. Waqas Ahmed Khan, Investigating Officer (I. O.) Deputy Director NAB who began his investigation and has since been pursuing this case. 3. On 09.04.2012, Mr. Waqas Ahmed Khan submitted for the Chairman’s approval , grounds of arrest and draft warrants for the arrest of Tauqir Sadiq and Mansoor Muzafa r Ali.

[5] The next day i.e. on 10.04.2012 the Director General (SOD) of NAB namely Col. (r) Shahzad Anwar Bhatti returned the file to Mr. Waqas Ahmed Khan with the direction “as discussed please prepare grounds of arrest and put up again” . This prima facie appears unusual as we have not been able to find any explanation on record for this conduct.

[6] According to the available record, the grounds for arrest and draft warrants had already been prepared and it was after such preparation that the file had been sent to the Director General in the first place. Since Col (r) Shahzad Anwar Bhatti is present in Court he shall file his explanation for this circumstance which , prima facie , appears unusual and may also be culpable . 4.

[7] The next day i.e. on 11.04.2012 Mr. Waq as Ahmed Khan again submitted the grounds of arrest and draft warrants a second time. 5 days later i.e. on 16.04.2012, the DG CMA  in CRP  3 (SOD) returned the file yet again directing that it be “put up after examining witnesses/accused persons” . This also prima facie s eems highly unusual since Mr.

[8] Waqas Ahmed Khan had already examined Mr. Muhammad Yasin, Registrar OGRA, who was petitioner in Const. Petition No.  and Jawad Jamil an accused in the case. This was done on 02.04.2012 and their statements had also been incorporated in the case diary. Nevertheless, Mr. Waqas Ahmed Khan went on to examine both Tauqir Sadiq and Mansoor Muzaffar on the same day i.e. 16.04.2012. 5.

[9] The next day i.e. on 17.04.2012 he resubmitted grounds of arrest and draft warrants for a thi rd time. The DG (SOD) returned the file to Mr. Waqas Ahmed Khan yet again asking “have we got any bank accounts to be analyzed?” . Mr. Waqas Ahmed Khan wrote back that all steps have been taken for scrutiny of the bank accounts and other requisite details have been taken for the scrutiny of the bank accounts.

[10] This time around, the DG (SOD) moved the file to the Chairman NAB with the observation dated 18.04.2012 that “we must discuss case progress please” . On 19.04.2012 the Chairman NAB received the file and approved the arrest warrants and grounds for arrest. However, this approval and the file did not get back to Mr.

[11] Waqas Ahmed Khan for another twelve( 12) days. This also prima facie appears to be a serious omission. The DG (SOD) shall explain this aspect o f the case also. It has been noted by Mr. Waqas Ahmed Khan that during this period Tauqir Sadiq and Mansoor Muzafar accused were frequently visiting NAB Headquarters for interrogation.

[12] The signed warrants finally got back to Mr. Waqas Ahmed Khan on 02.05.2 012, which can be termed as a very eventful day in the NAB Headquarters in Islamabad. 6. It is stated in the NAB Report (CMA ) that Tauqir Sadiq was within the NAB Headquarters building at the time when Mr. Waqas Ahmed Khan received the warrants.

[13] So he immediately called the guards at the reception through intercom and directed them to detain Tauqir Sadiq. It appears that the guards did detain Tauqir Sadiq. In the meanwhile, Mr. Waqas Ahmed Khan went to DG (SOD)’s office for numbering of the warran ts of arrest. It is stated in the aforesaid report that the DG (SOD) immediately took the warrants from Mr.

[14] Waqas Ahmed Khan and stepped out of the room. A short while later he returned and explained to Mr. Waqas Ahmed Khan that the warrants had been CMA  in CRP  4 signe d by the Chairman only as a result of confusion and that it was a mistake. Then, right in front of Mr. Waqas Ahmed Khan, the DG (SOD) “ destroyed the signed arrest warrants” .

[15] Tauqir Sadiq thereafter managed to escape from the NAB Headquarters prima facie on account of this most unusual sequence of event. The Chairman, NAB may explain these events. 7. On 07.05.2012 Mr. Waqas Ahmed Khan, I.O submitted fresh warrants and grounds of arrest for the Chairman’s approval. It may be noted that this was the 4th time that grounds for warrants and arrest had been prepared by the said IO.

[16] The following day i.e. on 08.05.2012 the Chairman signed the same. However, it took another one week before the signed warrants were sent and handed over to Mr. Waqas Ahmed Khan on 15.0 5.2012. This omission also requires to be explained. It was only on 15.05.2012 i.e. more than one month after arrest warrant s for Tauqir Sadiq had first been sought, that a search could be initiated to arrest him. 8.

[17] On 03.08.2012, Mr. Waqas Ahmed Khan pr epared a reference and sent it to the Prosecutor General NAB (PGA). The Additional PGA endorsed the reference on 08.08.2012. The PGA however, marked the file to one Mr. Ahmed Hayat Lak, General Manager, Legal Affairs of OGDCL and also Legal Advisor to Atto ck Petroleum.

[18] It is not clear from the record if Mr. Ahmed Hayat Lak had any nexus or concern with NAB or the matter which was being investigated by Mr. Waqas Ahmed Khan pursuant to our judgment dated 25.11.2011. We have noted that NAB has its own high pow ered legal team headed by a Prosecutor General who under Section 8 of the National Accountability Ordinance has the qualification s for being appointed a Judge of the apex Court.

[19] Even today, we have three legal persons namely Rana Zahid, Additional Prosecut or General NAB, Mr. Mazhar Ali Chohan, Deputy Prosecutor General NAB and Mr. Mehmood Raza, Additional Deputy Prosecutor General NAB who are present in Court. NAB may , therefore, explain as to what extraordinary qualifications were possessed by Mr.

[20] Ahmed Ha yat Lak which made his examination of matters indispensable for NAB and why it was that such senior functionaries in the legal department of NAB were considered either incompetent or unqualified to examine this matter? It may also be explained as to why a person potentially having a conflict of interest was considered for this purpose and what special qualifications CMA  in CRP  5 are possessed by him which prompted a reference to him.

[21] Mr. Waqas Ahmed Khan is present in Court and has been questioned. He states that a four page note was prepared by Mr. Ahmed Hayat Lak in which he indicated that a reference was made out only in respect of CNG and the other references were not justified. The I .O. Mr. Waqas Ahmed Khan responded by making some detailed noting on file.

[22] The matte rs noted above which have been taken from the NAB report (CMA ) shall be made part of a report along with notings mentioned above and the same shall be submitted in Court by NAB . According to Mr. Waqas Ahmed Khan, he decided that it would be highly improper for him to meet Mr. Ahmed Hayat Lak because there was a serious conflict of interest which in the opinion of Mr.

[23] Waqas Ahmed Khan was enough to disqualify Mr. Ahmed Hayat Lak. Since there appears to be no explanation on record , prima facie , there seems to be some dubious and improper conduct which needs to be explained by NAB as the investigating agency in the case. 9. On 27.09.2012 i.e. almost two months after Mr.

[24] Waqas Ahmed Khan had initially submitted the reference and more than ten months aft er the judgment dated 25.11.2011, Chairman NAB finally approved a reference but this reference was confined to those aspects of the case only which have been highlighted in paragraph 15 of Constitution Petition No.. It is stated by the IO that only 5 persons have been named in the reference although this number is likely to increase once the investigation progresses further and the trail leading up to the other accused is substantiated through some oral/documentary evidence.

[25] The other aspects of para 57 of our judgment and the persons identified as per sub -para 5(6) were not subjected to any probe or questioning. 10. Today we have heard Mr. Azam Khan, Director (Law) FIA, Mr. Waqas Ahmed Khan, Deputy Director NAB and Rana Shahid Pervaiz, SP Punjab Poli ce. From their statements made in Court, it appears that after escaping undetected from Pakistan, Tauqir Sadiq was apprehended by CID of UAE and was thereafter given in the custody of Interpol in UAE.

[26] It also appears from the statements made by these three persons that some steps may be in the contemplation of their organizations which may actually result in delaying or frustrating the return of Tauqir Sadiq to Pakistan . Specifically, it has been stated by all three officers that because the two passports w hich had been issued to Tauqir Sadiq by the CMA  in CRP  6 Pakistan passport office have been cancelled, the said individual has to be deported from UAE.

[27] This recourse has not been adopted and instead a long, unnecessary and protracted process is being contemplated for e xtraditing Tauqir Sadiq from UAE to Pakistan. Responding to the Court’s query, Mr. Waqas Ahmed Khan estimate d that deporting would take 6-7 days. SP Rana Shahid estimated that this could be achieved in around three days.

[28] Both averred that the extradition p roceeding, on the other hand, would definitely take much longer , possibly months. Prima facie extradition would not be required in this case because the very basis on which Tauqir Sadiq entered UAE i.e. the Pakistan passport issued to him, stands cancelled . According to the I.O. the residence/work visa of Tauqir Sadiq has already been cancelled by the UAE authorities. 11.

[29] Mr. Azam Khan, Director (Law) FIA, Mr. Waqas Ahmed Khan, Deputy Director NAB and Rana Shahid Pervaiz, SP Punjab Police shall submit thei r detailed reports in this behalf. We may note that Mr. Waqas Ahmed Khan, Deputy Director NAB and Rana Shahid Pervaiz, SP Punjab Police were in UAE since 15.01.2013 with the object of bringing Tauqir Sadiq back to Pakistan.

[30] The Foreign Office, Director Gen eral Passports and other relevant authorities are directed to provide all possible assistance to NAB, FIA and other authorities pursuing the arrest of the accused and his deportation to Pakistan. These authorities shall ensure that Tauqir Sadiq is brought to Pakistan before the next date of hearing . 12.

[31] Mr. Waqas Ahmed Khan, has informed us that on 30.01.2013 a reference against twelve individuals was prepared as per para 57(5)( b) of our judgment dated 25.11.2011 and the same has been forwarded through pro per channel and is likely to be signed by Chairman NAB. This reference relates to the selection process whereby Tauqir Sadiq was first vetted, interviewed and then finally appointed as Chairman OGRA.

[32] A 3rd reference under section 31 (a) of the NAO has also been prepared by the Deputy Director and has been forwarded on 28.01.2013 through proper channel for signing by the Chairman NAB. We have also been informed that the Executive Board Meetings (EMBs) have been held in NAB Rawalpindi for the purpose of forwa rding the aforesaid two references.

[33] However, EBMs at NAB Headquartes have still not taken place. NAB shall explain the reasons as to why this is so, considering the background which has been noted above and the fact that more than 14 months have elapsed si nce our order of 25.11.2011 , wherein the Chairman, CMA  in CRP  7 NAB was directed to “proceed in the matter with the promptness and diligence required in the matter”. 13.

[34] On a question put to him by the Court, the I.O/Deputy Director NAB stated that 41 bank accounts in different branches of various banks in the name of Tauqir Sadiq or his family members had been detected. In addition to the aforesaid accounts , three other accounts in the name of benami account holder s were also detected.

[35] These accounts contain ed a sum of around rupees three billion (Rs.3,000,000,000) but through an unusual occurrence, all 44 accounts were emptied and the amount s therein were siphoned off just before a caution was placed on the said accounts by NAB. As a result the amount of rupees 3 billi on was withdrawn and there are no funds left in the said 44 accounts.

[36] NAB shall explain as to how and why this was allowed to happen. 14. The evidence on record before us gives rise to questions relating to deportation/extradition. We may also require assi stance on the ambit and parameters of the provisions of chapter s XI and IX PPC and Section 31(a) of the NAO read together with section 476 and 476A of Cr.P.C.

[37] Further progress on the matter my require the assistance of amicus curi ae. Kh. Haris Ahmad , Sr. A SC may be asked to assist the Court in the case. 15. To come up on 07.02.2013 for consideration of the reports sought above and for passing appropriate orders. Civil Review Petition No. . Civil Review Petition No.  has been filed on behalf of NA B.

[38] The petitioner seeks review of our order dated 24.01.2013. The learned Prosecutor General NAB, Mr. K.K. Agha is busy before Bench No. 1 of this Court. He is not likely to be free any time soon and has requested to be accommodated. It is already 03:50 p. m. The Review Petition and the case (CMA ) is adjourned to 07.02.2013.
