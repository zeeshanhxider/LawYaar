[1] judgment dated 26.10.2022 passed by Sindh Service Tribunal Karachi in Appeal No.. Ishtiaq Anwar …Petitioner (s) Versus The Inspector General of Police Sindh & others …Respondent(s) For the Petitioner (s): In person For the Respondent(s): Mr. Suresh Kumar, Addl. AG, Sindh Ms. Lubna Pervez, AOR Date of Hearing: 25.03.2025 O R D E R Muhammad Shafi Siddiqui , J.- This petition has arisen out of an order of the Sindh Service Tribunal Karachi in terms whereof petitioner was compulsory retired from service as being a habitual late comer and absentee.

[2] The documentary evidence against the appellant in that regard was well discussed in the impugned order. The appellant used to come late in the office and the plea that he ha d taken is that he had to arrange certain official events because of which he used to come late. This explanation itself goes against him in view of the fact that had this been the situation he could have sought such exemption or at least exemption of comin g on time on the specific dates when the events were arra nged, which he has not done.

[3] Therefore, this plea is in itself an admission on the part of the petitioner of coming lat e without intimation, particularly in view of the fact that the attendance sheet was placed on record which revealed that whenever the appellant was on outdoor duty it was marked as “Out Working”. It is also well discussed in the impugned order as to how he has put his attendance in the bio -metric record though he was not on duty.

[4] In these circumstances, w e are in agreement with the finding Civil Petition No. 705-K/2022 2 of the Tribunal that the documentary evidence was such that there was no need to hold an inquiry under the law i.e. Removal from Service (Special Powers) Ordinance, 2000. We also do not find any reason to interfere in the order of the Tribunal.

[5] It is hereby upheld. Leave is refused and p etition stands dismissed. Judge Judge Karachi 25.03.2025 “Not approved for reporting ”
