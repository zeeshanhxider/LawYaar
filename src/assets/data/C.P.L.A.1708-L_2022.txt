On 06.07.2022 the G uardian Judge also re -called its earlier order dated 01.06.2022 due to non -submission of the requisite surety bond by the petitioner and ordered the police authorit ies to initiate proceedings against the petitioner.

In view of the above circumstances , the respondent filed Writ Petition No. in the Lahore High C ourt for recovery and custody of the minors.

[13] The custody of minors was handed over to the responden t by the Lahore High Court and W rit Petition No. was disposed of vide order dated 31.08.2022 in the following terms: “It is noticed that application under section 12 of the Guardian and Wards Act 1890, regarding grant of temporary custody of minors is still pending and fixed for arguments before the learned trial Court on 03.09.2022, therefore, it is appropriate to direct the parties to appear before the said Court for argumen ts on the said application, which shall be decided in any case on the same day.

[14] It is further observed that the learned trial Court vide order dated 01.06.2022 in Para No.6 made some observations regarding the stance taken by respondent No.5 (applicant bef ore the learned trial Court), which are hereby set aside with the direction to decide the application under section 12 of the Act (ibid), on merits, without being prejudiced by the observation made in the said order.

[15] However, the observations of this Court reflecting from today’s order are tentative in nature. Till then, the custody of minors shall remain with the petitioner and if the learned trial Court fails to decide the matter on the said date, she shall submit her explanation alongwith minors to this Court on 03.09.2022.” Feeling aggrieved of the above order dated 31.08.2022, passed by the Lahore High Court in Writ Petition No., the petitioner has filed CPLA No.3435 -L/2022. 11.

[18] In view of the above, in the order dated 19.04.2023 , the Lahore H igh Court held that the Writ Petition to the extent of setting aside the order dated 10.02.2023 has become infructuous but observed that in the interest CP.1708 -L/2022 etc 5 of justice and for welfare of the minors the petitioner may approach the Guardian Court with fresh application.

[19] By that time the petitioner had already submitted a fresh application before the Guardian C ourt which was fixed for 06.05.2023. The Lahore High Court directed th e parties to appear before the G uardian Judge on 26.04.2023 with direction to the Guardian Judge to proceed in accordance with law for recording statements of the minors and for medico -legal examination of minor Arham Adnan if so required after recording of the fresh statements.

[21] The following observations were also made by the Lahore High Court in its order dated 19.04.2023 in Writ Petition No.: “It is imperative to observe that this case is classical example where parents after their separation/divorce in order to satisfy their self -nurtured ego, make the minors a shuttlecock, which act in general is required to be de precated in our society. ” 15.

[22] According to the petitioner the order dated 19.04.2023 passed by Lahore High Court was not complied with in l etter and spirit by the Guardian J udge. 16. The petitioner challenged the order dated 19.04.2023 passed by Single Bench of the Lahore High Court in Writ Petition No. by filing Intra Court Appeal (ICA ) No. which was dismissed vide order dated 16.05.2023 holding the petitioner at liberty to raise his grievance before the Guardian Judge who shall dete rmine the factual controversy and decide the same within a period of ninety days from the date of receipt of certified copy of the order dated 16.05.2023.

Meeting of minors with the petitioner shall be subject to payment of complete maintenance allowance if any fixed by the court. It is hereby held that for implementation of above said schedule there shall be no need to move any separate m iscellaneous application as court shall issue Robkar for implementation on verbal request of the party concerned, which shall be made well in time and the same shall be incorporated in interim order.” 18.

[25] The above order was challenged by the petitioner by filing appeal before Addl. District Judge Lahore, which was dismissed vide order dated 02.11.2022 against which the petitioner filed Writ Petition No. with the contention that the order dated 19.04.2023 passed by the Lahore High Court in Writ Petition No. has not been complied with in letter and spirit by the Guardian J udge causing prejudice to the petitioner. 19.

[29] Feeling aggrieved of the above order passed by the Lahore High Court in Writ Petition No., the petitioner has filed CPLA No.3152 - L/2023 . 22. The petitioner submitted an application before the Guardian J udge for conducting the interviews of the minors in camera before the parties or their counsel due to apprehension that earlier the actual statements of the minors were not made part of the record.

[31] While dismissing the application of the petitioner for interview of the minors through video camera , the Guardian Judge observed that the minors are regularly appearing before the Court due to which there is no need to interview the minors through video camera. 23. The above order passed by Guardian Judge was challenged by the petitioner before the Lahore High Court by filing Writ Petition No. which has been dismissed with cost of Rs.25 ,000/ - vide order dated 05.12.2023 against which the petitioner has filed CPLA No.303 - L/2023 . 24.

[37] Tahir Mehmood ”7. 28. In view of the above, all these petitions arising out of interim orders passed by the Courts below are held not maintainable.
