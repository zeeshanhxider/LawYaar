It is further the case of the prosecution that the walle t of the alleged abductee containing cash of five thousand rupees, his Indiana State C ard, his University Card, Passport and Samsung mobile phone were also snatched during occurrence ; on 10.03.2006 at 12:30 p .m., the alleged abductee alongwith Arshad Saleem and Sattar were going from Es tate-I to Estate-II and on the way Arshad Saleem stopped at Khiali Chowk to get cigarette; while sitting in his car the alleged abductee saw four persons on motorcycle s and he identified them as kidnappers; when Arshad Saleem returned after purchasing cigarette , he in formed him about identifying the kidnappers and they chased the kidnappers while keeping some distance; the kidnappers turned to Nawan Pind from Awan Chowk and stopped their motorcycles in front of a house and entered therein; they inquired from shop keepe rs and came to know that Muhammad Afzal and Fayyaz both sons of Ghulam Rasool (proclaimed offenders) are residing in the said house while Qadeer ( the petitioner) and Muhammad Ali (proclaimed offender) are their friends who use d to visit them in the said house . 9.

[9] According to the prosecution, on spy information and on the pointation of informer, the petitioner was arrested on 24.03.2006 from J.P. No. 238 of 20 08 4 Alipur Chowk by-pass and on his personal search , a black color purse containing cash amount of twenty five hundred rupees, two university cards and one Samsung mobile were also recovered in respect whereof the recovery memo (Exb.PB) was prepared and the alleged abductee identified the recovered articles in police station; the identification parade of the petitioner was held on 04.04.2006 at about 12:25 pm in the premise of Central Jail, Gujranwala under supervision of Special Magistrate, Gujranwala wherein the alleged abductee identified the petitioner as co -accused ; on 14.0 4.2006 the petitioner led to recovery of two hundred thousand rupees of his share of ransom from an iron box lying in a room of his house which w ere taken into custody vide recovery memo (Exb.PE) and same were identified by the complainant in police station ; On 21.04.2006 the petitioner led to further recovery of forty thousand rupees from his house which were identified by the complainant in police station and on the same date a .30 bore pistol (Exb.

[10] P6) wrapped in plastic along with tw o live bullets ( Exb.P. -2) buried ten steps away from an electricity poll near Ganda Nala, Pasban Colony, Rajkot were also recovered on the pointation of petitioner. 10. We have heard learned counsel for the peti tioner (appointed by the Court) as well as learned Additional Prosecutor General, Punjab a nd perused the available record. 11.

[11] Despite allegation of repeated contacts by the accused with the complainant and his son Adil on cell phones as well as through PCO number , no Call Data Record ( ‘CDR’) with regard to the alleged phone calls has been produced at the trial. Muhammad Fahim and Muhammad Nadeem using telephone No. 055 -8300393 in their PCO (who were suspected by the complainant) were neither associated during investigation nor produced at the trial as witnesses or co - accused. 12.

[12] The alleged occurrence had taken place on 07.03.2006 but FIR No.  was registered at P.S. Dhulley, District Gujranwala by the complainant on 09.03.2006 . The petitioner has not furnished any explanation for inordinate delay of two days in registering the FIR. 13. In FIR No.  as well as during narration of the alleged occurrence by the alleged abductee to the complainant in the house on J.P.

[13] No. 238 of 20 08 5 07.03.2006 , the complainant as well as the alleged abductee did not mention about snatching of wallet containing cash amou nt of five thousand rupees, Indiana State Card, University Card, Passport or Samsung mobile. The alleged abductee as we ll as the complainant have fabricated/ made improvement to the above extent during investigation.

[14] Possibility of foisting the above articles upon the petitioner to create incriminating circumstantial evidence cannot be ruled out of consideration. 14. PW-3 Muhammad Jamal is business partner an d nephew of the complainant . His version about narration of the occurrence by the alleged abductee to his father is lacking independent corroboration.

[15] Hameed -ud-Din Awan , in whose presence the alleged abductee had narrated the details of the occurrence to the complainant , has not been produced by the prosecution at the trial. Mr. Adil (son of the complainant) who had allegedly received calls of the accused to arrange for the ransom at the earliest was neither associated during investigation nor produced at the trial as prosecution witness .

[16] On 18.09.2006 public prosecutor dropped prosecution witnesses namely Waheed -ud-Din, Abdul Sattar, Iftikhar Ali But and Muhammad Ramzan . 15. Under Article 129 (g) of the Qanoon -e-Shahadat Order, 1984 the Court may presume that evidence which could be and is not produced would, if produced, be unfavorable to the person who withholds it.

[17] Hence, a dverse inference is drawn to the effect that had the above witnesses been produced at the trial , they would ha ve not supported the prosecution case. Reliance in this regard is placed on the cases of “Muhammad J abran v. The State ”1 and “Mst. Sh ahnaz Akhtar v. Syed Ehsan ur Rehman ”2. 16.

[18] No bank record has bee n produced at the trial to prove encashment of rupees three million by the complainant on 07.03.2006 . Recoveries of rupees two hundred million and forty thousand from the house of the petitioner on his pointation in pursuance of his disclosure after more th an twenty days of his arrest is lacking independent corroboration as no notable or inhabitant of the area was associated 1 2020 SCMR 1493 2 2022 SCMR 1398 J.P.

[19] No. 238 of 20 08 6 during the alleged recoveries. The allegedly recovered cash was identified by the complainant in police station in absence of Special Judicial Magistrate . The complainant has failed to explain as to how he identified the currency notes . 17. While recording their statements at the trial the complainant (PW-6) as well as the alleged abductee (PW-7) have made dishonest improvement by stating that on the day of occurrence the accused had tied the hands of the alleged abductee whereafter he was put on the rear seat of the car.

[20] While making the above dishonest improvement , the alleged abductee has not mentioned as to who was driving the car when he was put on the rear seat of the car after tying his hands. 18. The version of the alleged abductee and Arshad Saleem (PW-5) that the accused were identified and chased by them on 10.03.2006 to a house and from the shop keep ers it revea led that the petitioner and his brother proclaimed offender Muhammad Ali being friends of the residents of the said house ( i.e. proclaimed offenders Muhammad Fayyaz and Muhammad Afzal ) used t o visit them in the said house , is also lacking independent corroboration as the shop keepers who had allegedly furnished information were neither assoc iated during investigation nor they have produced at the trial as prosecution witnesses. 19.

[21] The above version of the alleged abductee and Arshad Saleem is contra dicted by the statement of Mansab Ali, S.I./Investigating Officer who has stated at the trial that on 09.03.2006 the complainant, along with his son Zubair H aleem, Arshad Saleem and Abdul Sattar visited police station and made supplementary statement to the effect that his son has identified the kidnappers and their names were disclosed as Muhammad Afzal, Muhammad Fayyaz, Muhammad Ali and Abdul Qadeer. 20.

[22] According to prosecution , the identification parade of the petitioner was held on 04.04.2006 in Central Jail, Gujranwala under supervision of Special Judici al Magistrate, Gujranw ala Mr. Abdul Ghafoor (PW-4) wherein the alleged abductee identified the petitioner as accused . J.P. No. 238 of 20 08 7 During cross -examination Special Judicial Magistrate admitted that the petitioner had raised objectio n before the identification parade proceedings that he was shown to the abductee in the office of DSP.

[23] During cross -examination Special Judicial Magistrate also admitted that the alleged abductee stated before him that he might have been kidnapped by the accused. 21. Conten ts of the identification parade memo reveal that during identification parade , the a lleged abductee did not specify the role played by the petitioner in the alleged occurrence.

[24] It has repeatedly been held by this Court that identification of an accused person without reference to the role allegedly played by him during the o ccurrence is shorn of any evidentiary value. Refer ence in this regard is made to the cases of “Sabir Ali alias Fauji v. The state ”3, “Shafqat Mehmood v.

[25] The State ”4 “Muhammad Fayyaz v. The State ”5, “Azhar Mehmood v. The State ”6 and “Kamal Din alias Kamal a v. The State ”7. 22. All the above circumstances have created reasonable doubt in the case of the prosecution but benefit of same has not been extended to the petitioner by the courts below. According to settled principle of law even if a single circumstance creates a reasonable doubt in a prudent mind about the guilt of an accused he/she shall be entitled to such benefit not as a matter of grace and concession but as of right.

[26] Reference in this regard is made to the cases of “Tariq Pervaiz v. The State”8, “Ayub Masi h v. The State ”9, “Abdul Jabbar v. The State ”10, “Sarfraz v. The State ”11 and “Barkhurd ar v. The State ”12. 23. According to settled principles of law the prosecution has to stand on its own legs and if it fails to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt, the entire edifice of the prosecution would crumble down. 3 2011 SCMR 563 4 2011 SCMR 537 5 2012 SCMR 522 6 2017 SCMR 135 7 2018 SCMR 577 8 1995 SCMR 1345 9 PLD 2002 SC 1048 10 2019 SCMR 129 11 2023 SCMR 670 12 2023 SCMR 1791 J.P.
