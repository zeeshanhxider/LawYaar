Aman Ullah is inducted as a facilitator on behalf of the Criminal Petition No. 391 of 2020 2 petitioner , introduced as architect behind the crime with a motive .

Petitioner is admitted to bail and shall be released upon furnishing bond in the sum of Rs.500,000/ - with one surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of the learned trial Court /Duty Judge .
