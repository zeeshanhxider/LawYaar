[2] Muhammad Mustafa, DPG Date of Hearing : 1.7.2019. JUDGMENT Qazi Muhammad Amin Ahmed , J.- The appellants alongside co -accused, armed with Kalashnikovs, confronted a contingent of Police Station Kalabagh District Mianwali , set out to arrest accused in a case of homicide , hiding themselves in an Afghan Refugee Camp on 11.4.2012 ; the camp was encircle d at 11 :45 a.m. when the appellants and co -accused opened fire , in consequence whereof , Ahmed Nawaz/C came in the line of fire; he was fatally shot and his official SMG was snatched by the accused; Muhammad Iqbal, appellant sustained injuries during the indiscriminate firing.

[3] Besides the appellants, Hazrat Gul, Ghulam Sarwar and Izat Ullah alongside three unknown were arrayed in the crime report ; Hazrat Gul was extended benefit of doubt by the trial Court Cr. Appeal No.160 -L/2017 & Cr. Petition 641 -L/2016 - 2- whereas Ghulam Sarwar and Izat Ullah stayed away from law. Prosecution is clueless about the unknown till date.

[4] Spot inspection includes seizure of blood and 17 casings of Kalashnikovs ; Muhammad Iqbal, appellant , subdued in injured condition , was shifted to the hospital whereas Muhammad Sharif and Hazrat Gul were arrested on 22.4.2012 ; upon disclosure, Muhammad Sharif led to the recovery of Kalashnikov, P -9, as well as snatched SMG , P-8; Hazrat Gul got recovered Kalashnikov , P-11.

[5] The appellants were returned a guilty verdict on different counts with penalty of death by an Anti Terrorism Court at Sargodha vide judgment dated 13.8.2013 ; their appeal was dismissed in the High Court ; maintaining Muhammad Sharif 's sentence , however , death penalty awarded to Muhammad Iqbal was altered into imprisonment for life vide impugned judgment dated 28.9.201 5 vires whereof are being assailed through leave of the Court; complainant seeks enhancement of sentence; both the issues , with a common thread , are being decided through this single judgment. 2.

[6] Hot pursuit by the police contingent for the arrest of accused in a case of homicide is a circumstance ante dated in point of time , therefore , beyond doubt; pursuant to information, police officials came face -to-face with the appellants. It was during the search that one of the members of the police party , though clad in civvies , was fatally shot ; receipt of injur ies by Muhammad Iqbal appellant, his arrest at the spot and admission in the hospital , under a police docket , are also circumstances hard to deny.

[7] In this backdrop, presence of police officials, for a purpose mandated by law, at the crime scene, stands fully established. Subsequent recoveries squarely corrobor ate the ocular account . Examined in the above framework, the witnesses furnished accounts, confidence inspiring by all means , for being intrinsically sound in the face of inconsequential cross -examination , by and large , based upon denied suggestions .

[8] Acquittal of Hazrat Gul , seemingly out of abundant caution , does not adversely reflect upon the case qua the appellants ; he is assigned a general role and a positive forensic report based upon empties , dispatched Cr. Appeal No.160 -L/2017 & Cr. Petition 641 -L/2016 - 3- subsequent to arrest , would not qualify to the required standard of proof so as to view his presence in the community of intention beyond reasonable doubt ; the appellants assigned effective roles qua the deceased are placed in a vastly different position; they have been rightly convicted, however insofar as quantum of sentence to be exacted from Muhammad Sharif appellant is concerned, he is identically placed; as the casings found wedded with gun P/9 were also dispatched sub sequent to his arrest , a factor received by the High Court as a mitigating circumstance qua Muhammad Iqbal , appellant, the same goes squarely for Muhammad Sharif .

[9] Consequently , penalty of death awarded to Muhammad Sharif is also altered into imprisonment f or life ; remainder of convictions as well as sentences conseq uent thereupon are kept intact; sentences shall run concurrently with benefit of Section 382 -B of the Code of Criminal Procedure , 1898 . Resultantly, Criminal Appeal is dismissed .

[10] As a natural corollary, Criminal Petition is also dismissed . JUDGE JUDGE Lahore , the 1st July, 2019 Not approved for reporting Ghulam Raza/* JUDGE
