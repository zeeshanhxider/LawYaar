[1] ORDER Mr. Shahid Hamid, learned Sr. ASC who appeared on behalf of the Appellant in Civil Appeal No.56 -L of 2018 has been heard . The question of the maintainability of the instant appeal s against the judgment of the learned Single Bench of the Lahore High Court, Lahore filed in the absence of Intra Court Appeal s having been filed in terms of Section 3 of the Law Refo rms Ordinance, 1972 is in issue .

[2] The question of the locus standi of the Appellant, who is the Speaker, National Assembly of Pakistan also needs to be determined. 2. The lis in the instant case s primarily revolves around the Nomination Forms for CA Nos.56 -L-2018 etc. 4 candidat es of the National Assembly and Provincial Assemblies issued in terms of Election s Act, 2017 and the omissions therein when compared wit h the such Nomination Forms issued in terms of Representation of the People Act, 1976 (ROPA) (since repealed ).

[3] The adju dication in this behalf requir es interpretation of various provisions of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 including Articles 62, 63, 218 to 222, therefore , notice is issued to the learned Attorney General for Pakistan in terms of Order XXVII -A CPC. 3. Today, the question of interim relief needs to be examined .

[4] On the last date of hearing, while granting leave to appeal , operation of the impugned judgment was also suspended without hearing the opposite side . With regard to the info rmation omitted from the Nomination Papers and Form A & B, as issued in terms of Election s Act, 201 7, when examined in juxtaposition with the requirement of the Nomination Forms previously in vogue under the ROPA , 1976 , it appears that the information , no CA Nos.56 -L-2018 etc. 5 longer required to be disclosed, prima facie , would facilitate the determination of the qualification or disqualification of a candidate and would lead to greater transparency regarding the credentials of a candidate facilitating the electorate in making a more informative choice. 4.

[5] In the above backdrop, on Court query, the learned Sr. ASC for the Appellant stated that neither his client (Speaker of the National Assembly) nor the Political Party to which his client belonged has any objection to the discl osure of said additional information and the leadership of such political party has come on record in this behalf.

[6] However, as per his contention s, some of such information previously required in the Nomination Forms is not really necessary. With his assis tance, we examined each and every omitted clause of the Nomination Forms issued under ROPA , 1976 , The learned counsel , at this stage , could not persuade us that such disclosure in any manner would prejudice a ny candidate.

[7] At best, some information may perh aps be unnecessary or surplus. CA Nos.56 -L-2018 etc. 6 5. As an interim measure, we believe that such additional information, which was required to be disclosed through the Nomination Papers & Forms under ROPA , 1976 and now omitted through Nomination Papers contemplated by the E lection s Act, 2017 must be disclosed by a candidate.

[8] Such disclosure is necessary to ensure the sanctity and integrity of the General Elections, 2018, as if the instant appeals eventually fail, complications in this behalf may arise . The learned counsel fo r the ECP also supports such interim measures. 6. Mr. Babar Yaqoob Fateh, Secretary, Election Commission of Pakistan present in the Court was directed to prepare a draft Affidavit to be submitted by a Candidate disclosing the requisite information omitte d by the Election s Act, 2017.
