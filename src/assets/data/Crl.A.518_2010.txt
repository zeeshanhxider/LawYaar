[1] order dated 26.01.2009 passed by the Islamabad High Court Islamabad in Criminal Original No.73 of 2008 ) Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan …Appellant (s) Versus Nadeem H. Shaikh and others …Res pondent (s) For the Appellant (s): Syed Hamid Ali Shah, ASC Mr. Tari q Aziz, AOR For Respondent Nos. 5,6,9,14,16 : Mr.

[2] Tanvir -ul-Islam, ASC For Respondent Nos. 18 & 19 Mr. Naeem Bukhari, ASC For Respondent No.3 Mr. Nayab Gardezi, ASC Date of hearing: 27.10.2020. ORDER Qazi Muhammad Amin Ahmed, J. - Impugned herein is order dated 21.1.2009, passed in Criminal Original No.73 of 2008 titled as Security & Exchange Commission of Pakistan Vs.

[3] Nadeem H. Sheikh & 32 others by the then Islamabad High Court to draw up proceedings against two from amongst a large array of the respondents under section 282 -K of the Companies Ordinance , 1984 . Exoneration of majority of the respondents was assailed through leave of the Court granted vide order passed as far back as on 14.12.2010 .

[4] It is in this backdrop that despite repeated directions and opportunities generously granted by the Court from time to time , the appellant persisted in its failure to provide the addresses of the respondents so as to bring the issue, in the fullness of time, to its logical end , sooner rather than later; last order being on 25.02.2020 that runs as follows: “Ibrar Saeed, Law Officer appearing on behalf of the appellant requests for four weeks’ time.

[5] Time as requested is granted, but with a Criminal Appeal No. 518 of 2010 2 caution that in case the appellant still fails to comply, the appeal shall stand dismissed. The notice stands discharged. ” There is no improvement in the state of affairs even today; the learned counsel for the appellant, when confronted with the non -compliance, stated that he had furnished requisite inform ation to the Ad vocate -on- Record, however, the latter when summoned , took a different plea , diametrically inconsistent with the position taken by the former and instead persuaded th e Court for substitute service, a request that cannot be acceded to without disregard to the order earlier passed by this Court .

[6] Law assists the vigilant even in causes most valid and justiciable . Similarly, fixation of cases before Benches entails public expense and time, that must not be incurred more than once in the absence of a reason most genuine and compelling. Delay caused by the appellant in doing the needful is exasperating.

[7] We do not feel persuaded to allow this long drawn inaptitude to further encumber pendency of the Court. Dismissed. Judge Judge Judge Islamabad , the 27th October , 2020 Not approved for reporting Azmat /-
