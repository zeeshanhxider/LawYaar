[1] judgment in the matter. 4. Learned counsel for the petitioners urges that the judgment in the case has been reserved without grant of hearing to the petitioners. The respondent No.2 has responded that notwithstanding a clear direction that the arguments in the matter shall be heard, the learned counsel for the petitioners did not sh ow up even once throughout the Const.P.18 of 2019. 4 proceedings and he was represented by a person holding his brief.

[2] It is in the said circumstances that the learned counsel for the petitioners pleads for the Constitution Petition No.D - 444 of 2019 pending before the Sindh Hig h Court be transferred to the Islamabad High Court. 5. Although comments by the petitioners were filed in the Constitution Petition No.D -444 of 2019, however, it is apparent that their counsel never attended such proceedings on their behalf.

[3] In the ordinary course, the learned High Court Bench would have in such a situation , issued a direction to the learned counsel to attend the proceedings to argue his case failing which the matter would be decided in his absence. This was not done ; instead, it app ears that the Bench treated Ms. Rohaila Nazar, Advocate as the counsel for the petitioners and closed the hearing after her statement adopting the arguments by the counsel for the respondents No.2 & 5 .

[4] The se respondents are the two other members of the ECP who are disputed in Constitution Petition No.D -444 of 2019 . On that basis the hearing was closed and the judgment was reserved. 6. We notice that t he present petition is filed to overcome the consequence of default in appearance by the learned counsel f or the petitioner s before the Sindh High Court .

[5] Otherwise, the petitioners’ objection to the alleged lack of jurisdiction of the Sindh High Court in Constitution Petition No.D -444 of 2019 has already been taken in their pleadings/comments filed in the Court. That objection has also Const.P.18 of 2019. 5 been argued on behalf of the two other disputed Members of the ECP.

[6] Therefore, it is premature and inappropriate for us to hear th at objection presently because the High Court seized of the matter shall soon be pronouncing it s judgment there on. However, such judgment when delivered shall lack the attribute of being passed after grant of an opportunity of a hearing to the petitioners .

[7] The absence of an opportunity being granted expressly is a deficiency that would seriously imp air the effectiveness of the judgment . The right of hearing of a party to a lis is one of the fundamental principles of our jurisprudence which is guarantee d by Article 10A of the Constitution in its assurance of a “ fair trial and due process ” to a litigan t.

[8] Accordingly , on the one hand , for the lack of an express opportunity of exercising such a right being expressly granted to the petitioners before us (respondents No.3 & 4 in the proceedings of Constitution Petition No.D -444 of 2019 ) and on the other han d, for the default of the petitioners to produce their counsel for making submissions before the Sindh High Court, we observe that it would suffice if the learned High Court Bench that has reserved the judgment may whilst writing the same take into consideration written submissions that are filed on behalf of the petitioners on or before 30.09.2019 .

[9] These written submissions shall not include any new material or plea. In case the petitioners do not file their submissions on or before such date in the office of the Registrar of the High Court of Sindh (for their placement on Const.P.18 of 2019. 6 the case file of Constitution Petition No.D -444 of 2019 ), the learned High Court Bench that has heard the matter may forthwith proceed to anno unce its judgment at an early date.

[10] This petition stands disposed of in above terms. JUDGE JUDGE Islamabad, 26.09.2019. Irshad Hussain /* JUDGE NOT APPROVED FOR REPORTING.
