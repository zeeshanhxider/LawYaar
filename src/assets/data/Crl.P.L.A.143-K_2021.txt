[1] judgment dated 22.10.2021 passed by the High Court of Sindh Karachi in Cr. Bail Application No.S-733 of 202 1) Ghulam Qadir …Petitioner (s) Versus The State …Res pondent (s) For the Petitioner (s): Ms. Abida Parveen Channar, ASC/AOR with petitioner. For the State : N.R. Date of hearing: 25.11.2021 . ORDER Qazi Muhammad Amin Ahmed, J. - Apprehending arrest in a case of murderous assault, Ghulam Qadir, petitioner, unsuccessfully attempted for bail in anticipation thereto ; lastly on 22.10.2021 before a learned Judge -in-Chamber of the High Co urt of Sindh, Circuit Court Hyderabad .

[2] According to the prosecution, on the eventful day i.e. 12.8.2021 , accompanied by co -accused, each differently armed , the petitioner in the backdrop of a trivial dispute, inflicted a club blow to Manzoor PW while the co-accused targeted Muhammad Ibrahim and S haman ; medico legal report s confirm ed receipt of multiple injuries by the witnesses . 3.

[3] Pleading denial and innocence, learned counsel for the petitioner contends that it is a case of wider net wherein each able - bodied member of the opponent side has been taken on board to face the rigors of an unjust prosecution, however, she concedes that according to the investigation, henceforth conducted, the Investigating Officer has not yet ruled out his participation in th e crime ; she has lastly referred to a delay of no less than five days in registration of the Criminal Petition No. 143-K of 2021 2 case to conclude that the intended arrest is not free from the taints of mala fide . 2.

[4] Heard. Record perused. 3. Contents of the First Information Report suppor ted by the statements of the witnesses and findings recorded by the Medical Officer run counter to the hypothesis of denial . Though the formal First Information Report was recorded on 17.8.2021, however, the injured with extensive injuries were medically e xamined under police docket s on 13.8.2021 ; according to the provisional medico legal certificate s, they had reached hospital on 12.8.2021 at 6:00 p.m. just half an hour after the incident and, thus, delay in formal registration of the case, a phenomena har dly unusual, does not raise eyebrows.

[5] Even otherwise, in the absence of any apparent mala fide on part of the complainant or the local police , the petitioner cannot claim extraordinary/equitable concession of pre -arrest bail in a criminal case wherein no l ess than three persons endured multiple injuries , one being an incised wound on the back of neck with exposed bone .

[6] Arguments addressed by the learned counsel , being part of post arrest agenda, cannot be attended at pre-arrest bail stage, certainly not a s ubstitute for post arrest bail. The High Court as well as the Court of Session , on the assessment of above referred to material , rightly declined judicial protection to the petitioner .

[7] Petition fails. Leave declined. Chief Justice Judge Judge Karachi , the 25th November , 202 1 Azmat /-
