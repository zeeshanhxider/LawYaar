[2] ORDER Qazi Muhammad Amin Ahmed, J. - From a mongst a large array of accused, prosecuted through a private complaint after complainant’s dissatisfaction with the investigative process, Fateh Sher, petitioner, alone was returned a guilty ve rdict in a case of homicide by a learned Additional Sessions Judge at Pindi Bhatian ; convicted under clause (b) of section 302 of the Pakistan Penal Code, 1860 vide judgment dated 01.8.2013 , he was sentenced to death , altered into imprisonment for life by the learned High Court vide impugned judgment dated 12.3.2018 , vires whereof are being assailed on a variety of grounds , wholesale failure of prosecution case being most prominent .

[3] The incident is a night affair on fringe of the village Abadi when accord ing to the complainant he accompanied the deceased and the injured at 10:45 p.m, without any apparent purpose . Besides the petitioner, his brothers Ikram Ullah and Ihsan Ullah, each lethally armed, alongside three unknown , confronted them with fire shots .

[4] Abid Hussain and Asghar Ali PWs were statedly attracted to the scene at Jail Petition No.317 of 2018 2 that unearthly hour of the night to witness the occurrence , instigated by Javed co -accused . Through a supplementary statement purportedly recorded on 24.5.2010 , unknown assailants were introduced by their names with specific roles.

[5] The co-accused were exonerated by the Investigating Officer and the complainant having found investigative conclusions inconsistent with the case set up in the crime report, preferred a private complaint which again resulted into failure barring the petitioner . Prosecution’s failure qua majority of the accused , one of whom is indivisibly assigned identical role, question of identity of the assailant s in a moonlit night as mentioned in the crime report, an unan ticipated encounter between the deceased and the injured with the assailants and inconsequential forensic report, makes out a case for reappraisal of evidence to ensure safe administration of criminal justice .
