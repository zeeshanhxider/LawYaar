Case Name: Mrs. Tasneem Abbas v. Additional District Judge, Lahore and others

JUDGMENT

[1] Through the instant appeal, the appellant Mrs. Tasneem Abbas assails the judgment dated 07.05.2012 passed by the Lahore High Court, whereby writ petition No.28906/2011 filed by the appellant against the appellate court’s judgment dated 06.07.2011 was dismissed. The appellate court had allowed the appeal preferred by respondent No.3, Hafiz Ayaz Aalam Usmani, against the Rent Tribunal’s order dated 09.03.2011, which had directed respondent No.3 to vacate the ground floor of House No.8-C/1, Shahid Colony, Ferozpur Road, Lahore (“the demised premises”).

[2] The appellant sought eviction on grounds of (i) default in rent payment, (ii) personal bona fide need, and (iii) violation of the rent agreement dated 31.12.1996 by using the property commercially. Respondent No.3 denied the landlord-tenant relationship. The Rent Tribunal accepted the eviction petition and ordered respondent No.3 to vacate within two months and pay rent arrears at Rs. 4,400 per month from January 2000.

[3] Respondent No.3 appealed, asserting that he purchased the premises himself and that the appellant was merely a benami owner. He also challenged the authenticity of his signatures on the rent agreement. The appellate court compared his signatures with those on his CNIC and passport, found them dissimilar, and relied on a bank letter dated 10.07.2008 to support his claim. It held that the appellant failed to prove the landlord-tenant relationship and that she should pursue ownership in a civil court.

[4] The High Court dismissed the appellant’s writ petition, holding that the tenancy agreement was not compliant with the Punjab Rented Premises Ordinance, 2007 (“the 2007 Ordinance”) and that the appellant had not deposited the fine required under Section 9.

[5] The Supreme Court noted that while respondent No.3 had cited non-compliance with Sections 8 and 9 of the Ordinance in his appeal, the appellate court had not based its decision on this. The High Court, however, upheld the decision without identifying which provisions were violated.

[6] Under Sections 8 and 9 of the 2007 Ordinance, existing tenancies were required to be brought in conformity within two years, and landlords who failed to comply had to pay a fine of 10% of the annual rent to file proceedings. Neither court specified how the tenancy failed to conform.

[7] The Supreme Court assumed that the High Court was referring to Section 5 of the Ordinance, which mandates registration of tenancy agreements with the Rent Registrar. However, the appellant’s eviction petition was filed within the two-year grace period, and respondent No.3 never raised this objection before the Rent Tribunal.

[8] Citing Abdul Hameed Talib v. Additional District Judge, Lahore (PLD 2013 SC 775), the Court reiterated that Rent Tribunals must allow landlords to deposit the fine before halting proceedings rather than dismissing petitions outright for non-compliance.

[9] The Court noted that at the time of filing (09.01.2008), the grace period had not expired, and existing case law such as Majid Khan v. Naseem Bibi (PLD 2010 Lahore 389) had held that eviction petitions could not be dismissed solely due to non-registration.

[10] Therefore, the High Court erred by dismissing the case instead of giving the appellant an opportunity to cure the defect by paying the fine. The appellate court’s reasoning that the civil ownership dispute barred eviction proceedings was also inconsistent with precedents such as Mst. Musarrat Shaheen v. Mst. Verbeena Khan Afroz (2024 SCMR 1796) and others.

[11] The Supreme Court further held that the appellate court wrongly relied on a letter (Exh.R1/A) from a bank without producing any witness or account forms in evidence. Under Article 84 of the Qanoon-e-Shahadat Order, 1984, comparison of signatures by judges without expert input is discouraged and inconclusive, as held in Sumaira Malik v. Umar Aslam Awan (2018 SCMR 1432) and Rehmat Ali Ismaila v. Khalid Mehmood (2004 SCMR 361).

[12] Consequently, both the appellate court’s and the High Court’s judgments were declared unsustainable. The Supreme Court remanded the matter to the appellate court, directing it to allow the appellant to pay the fine under Section 9(a) of the 2007 Ordinance and then decide the appeal accordingly. The Court also ordered maintenance of status quo regarding possession of the demised premises during pendency.
