[1] judgment of Islamabad High Court, Islamabad dated 02.07.2024 passed in C.R. No. ) Asma Haleem …Petitioner Versus Abdul Haseeb Chaudhry and others …Respondent s For the Petitioner (s): Mr. Abdul Wahid Qureshi Mr. Tariq Aziz, AOR For the Respondent(s): Not represented Date of hearing: 30.07.2024 ORDER Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, J . – Brief facts of the case are that the petitioner filed a suit for partition, permanent, possession, permanent and mandatory injunction regarding the built -up property constructed house two floors over land measuring 1 Kanal numbered as Plot No. 7 -M, Raja Akhtar Road, Korang Valley, Shahpur, Barakahu, Islamabad .

[2] The suit property was owned by the father of the parties and after necessary proceedings, the trial court issu ed a preliminary decree vide order dated 13.01.2020 and appointed a local commission. Subsequently, reserve price of the suit property was fixed by the trial court which was objected by the petitioner on 16.03.2020.

[3] Thereafter, a court auctioneer was appoi nted by the trial court who conducted the auction proceedings and submitted his final report to the court on 18.03.2023 which was also objected by the petitioner. The said objections were turned down by the trial court vide order dated 12.04.2023 against w hich the petitioner preferred an appeal which was allowed vide order dated 08.07.2023.

[4] A revision petition was filed by the respondent No. 7 before the Islamabad High Court , Islamabad which was allowed vide judgment dated 02.07.202 4 (“impugned judgment ”). Hence, the instant petition for leave to appeal. C.P.L.A. No.  2 2. We have heard the learned counsel for the petitioner at some length and have gone through the impugned judgment of the High Court, examined the law on the subject and the record of the case.

[5] We have no t been able to take any exception to the impugned judgment and are of the view that the present petition is completely frivolous and vexatious and the process of th e court has been abused by the petitioner just to pressurize the other side and delay the ma tter on one pretext or the other, thereby depriving her siblings and mother from the lawful auction of the said suit property.

[6] Therefore, it does not warrant any interference. 3. Before parting with this Order, it is significant to highlight that according to the statistics provided by the Law & Justice Commission of Pakistan, there are about 2.2 million (2,255,295) cases pending before all courts in the country .1 Such frivolous, vexatious and speculative litigation unduly burdens the courts giving artificial rise to pendency of cases which in turn clogs the justice system and delays the resolution of genuine disputes.

[7] Such litigation is required to be rooted out of the system and strongly discouraged and one of the ways to curb such practice of instituting frivolous and vexatious cases is by imposing of costs under Order XXVIII, Rule 3 of the Supreme Court Rules, 1980 which lay the foundation for expeditious justice and promote a smart legal system, enhancing access to justice by entertaining genuin e claims.2 In view of the aforesaid, leave is, therefore, declined and this petition is dismissed with costs of Rs. 50,000/ - to be paid to the respondents and in case of its failure, the same shall be recoverable as a money decree.

[8] Copy of this Order be dispatched to the respondents for information. Judge Judge Judge Islamabad 30 July 2024 Approved for R eporting Sadaqat /Umer A.
