AG Date of Hearing: 14.04 .2014 ORDER This order follows from our last order dated 7.4.2014. Through that order, we had made certain observations and had also requ ested Malik Muhammad Rafique Rajwana, senior Member of our Bar to assist the Court in this matter.

[4] He is present. We have heard him and the Law Officers of the four Provinces and the Federation. Furthermore, Dr. Shakeel ur Rehman, Food Security Commissione r in the Ministry of National Food Security & Research and Mr. Taufiq Asif, learned counsel for the applicant Mr. Liaquat Baloch have been heard.

[5] There is a general opinion amongst all of these gentlemen that an effort is required to ensure that the minimu m nutritional needs of the citizens are met. To ensure this, the minimum standard prescribed for daily calorie intake, prescribed by the Ministry of National CMA - in Const. P. 2 Food Security & Research, Govt. of Pakistan is maintained for every single citizen of Pakistan.

[6] Dr . Shakeel ur Rehman has pointed out that the Pakistan standard for minimum daily intake of calories is 2350 calories for a person. 2. After hearing the above mentioned Law Officers and learned amicus, it is this minimum standard which will ensure that th e fundamental rights mentioned in Article 9, 14 and the principles of policy set out in Article 38 of the Constitution are assured. 3.

[7] A report (CMA -) has been submitted by the learned Additional Attorney General for Pakistan pursuant to our previo us order. This report purports to contain input from all four Provinces. The report, however, is incomplete as it does not contain relevant information and statistics to enable this Court to ascertain if indeed the fundamental rights mentioned above are be ing assured to the citizens of the country.

[8] The Learned Law Officers, therefore, shall submit a complete consolidated report which should also include relevant statistical data aimed at demonstrating that the fundamental rights mentioned above are being me t. 4. It has been suggested by Mr. Taufiq Asif, learned counsel for the applicant that some very sound basis for on-spot determinations need s to be made as to the price of at least one essential food item i.e. atta and the price at which generally it is available in various parts of the country.

[9] This suggestion is reasonable and has the support of all of the learned counsel/Law Officers named above. In the circumstances, four committees are constituted comprising Syed Attique Shah, learned Additional Attor ney General for Pakistan, Mr. Taufique Asif, learned ASC together with, in the case of each Province, the Law Officer of the Province respectively who is before us.

[10] The mandate of these committees will be to make on-spot check s for the purpose of assistin g us in ascertaining the price/availability of atta/flour in the context of enforcement of the fundamental rights noted above. CMA - in Const. P. 3 5. On the previous date of hearing we had noted that the minimum wage of an unskilled worker in the four Provinces is Rs.7000/ - to Rs.9000/ -.

[11] Dr. Shakeel Ahmed Khan was, therefore, asked to prepare a table to show as to how a family comprising two adults and two minors would be able to survive with dignity as per Article 14 of the Constitution within the minimum wage. 6. It was su ggested by Malik Muhammad Rafique Rajwana, learned amicus that the Federal Government could also convene a meeting of the responsible government functionaries of the Federation and the Provinces for the purpose of informing the Court as to possible ways an d means through which the fundamental rights under Articles 9 and 14 of the Constitution can be assured to the citizens of Pakistan.

[12] Let this also be done and a report be submitted in Court before the next date of hearing. 7. Let the case come up for hear ing on 22nd April, 2014. Judge Judge ISLAMABAD 14th April , 2014 M. Azhar Malik
