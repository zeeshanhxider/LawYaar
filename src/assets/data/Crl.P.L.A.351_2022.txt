[11] Feeling aggrieved of their conviction a nd sentence, the convicts have filed the instant Criminal Petitions for Leave to A ppeal. 8. After hearing learned counsel for the petitioners and learned Additional Prosecutor General, Sindh, we have perused the available Crl. Ps. No.351 -352, 438, 50 -K, 76 -77-K, 92 -K, 94 -K of 2022 - 4 - record which reveals that the two escapee UTPs were confined in Ward No. 26 of Central Prison K arachi .

[12] On 13.06.2017 both the escapee UTPs were not required to be produced before any ATC Court situated in the Judicial Complex adjacent to Central Prison Karachi for hearing/trial procee dings . In absence of any order u/s 41 of the Prisoners Act, 1900 for production of the two escapee UTPs before ATC Court on 13.06.2017 , their names were included in the list of prisoners to be produced before ATC C ourts on 13.06.2017 due to which their cus tody was shifted through the tunnel from Central Prison Karachi to the Judicial Lockup of ATC Courts situated in the adjacent Judicial Complex .

[13] On the said date Nawab Khan SPC was Incharge of Ward No s.25 and 26 and he was assisted by Abdul Ghafoor PC and A tta Muhammad PC . 9. It reveals that Arshad Ali Aziz (PW.13) , having been convicted in a narcotics case, along with another convict (whose name has not come on record ), were deputed by Yasir Ali (Production Clerk ATC) with the permission of Rafique Ahmed Ch anna (Tower Incharge) to work in the prison and perform duty of maintaining the register of UTPs required to be produced before the ATC Courts. 10.

[14] In absence of any production order by the ATC C ourt, the names of the two escapee UTPs were wrongly inserte d in the list of UTPs required to be produced before ATC Courts on 13.06.2017 by the prisoner Arshad Ali Aziz but surprisingly, instead of arraying him as co -accused, he was produced by the prosecution at the trial as PW.13. 11.

[15] On 13.06.2017 Ward No. 26 was unlocked by Abdul Ghafoor PC and counting of the prisoners was also made by Abdul Ghafoor PC on the said date. It reveals that on the said date, on the instruction of Abdul Ghafoor PC, Atta Muhammad PC escorted both the escapee UTPs to ATC Court No.7 s ituated in the Judicial Complex. 12.

[16] Evidence reveals that on 13.06.2017 the escapee UTP Muhammad Ahmed had met with PW.9 Zeeshan (Reader of ATC Court No. 7) in the court room and inquired from him about presence of his advocate and about filing of his bai l application while on the said date escapee UTP Sheikh Muhammad Mumtaz wanted t o see his lawyer in the premises of the Judicial Complex. 13.

[17] On 13.06.2017 Faroosh Muhammad ASI Prison s was Incharge of ATC Court Escort /production area and he was assisted b y Muhammad Crl. Ps. No.351 -352, 438, 50 -K, 76 -77-K, 92 -K, 94 -K of 2022 - 5 - Taghyal Meh ar PC, Muhammad Sajjad PC , Saeed Ahmed PC and Nadir Hussain PC ; Muhammad Tag hyal Meh ar PC and Muhammad Sajjad PC were deputed at ATC Court No. 11, Nadir Hussain PC was deputed at ATC Court No. 12 while Saeed Ahmed PC was deputed at ATC Court No. 7 situated in the Judicial Complex .

[18] On the said date, being i ncharge of the production area it was duty of Faroosh Muhammad ASI Prison s to unlock/lock the production area . 14. The escapee UTP Muhammad Ahmed Khan was produced by Saeed Ahmed PC in ATC Court No. 7 on 13.06.2017 and he along with other UTPs were to be sent back to the prison and after closing the ATC Courts , the production area was to be locked. 15.

[19] Evidence reveals that without sending the two escapee UTPs back to prison, Saeed Ah med PC reported OK to Faroosh Muhammad ASI Prison s about closing the ATC Courts. Being i ncharge ATC Court Escort/produc tion area , Faroosh Muhammad ASI Prison s did not ensure return of the two escapee UTPs back to the prison.

[20] On return of all the UTPs , except the two escapee UTPs, in Ward Nos.25 and 26 on 13.06.2017 in Central Prison Karachi from the Judicial Complex/ATC Courts , Abdul Ghafoor PC wrongly declared correct numbers of the UTPs in the relevant register No.10/lockup report despite missing of the two escapee UTPs . 16.

[21] In the early morning of 14.06.2017 , when the UTPs were being counted for production in ATC Courts , it revealed that the two escapee UTPs are missing and the matter was immediately reported to the High ups. 17. The evidence available on record reveals that with the active connivance of Abdul Ghafoor PC, Saeed Ahmed PC and Faroosh Muhammad ASI Prison s, the esc apee UT Ps managed their escape after cutting the iron bars /grill of lockup of ATC Court No. 18 situated on the first floor of the Judicial Complex and after shaving their beard and cutting their hair in the washroom of ATC Court No.18 . 18.

[22] The overwhelming incriminating evidence proves sharing of common intention and active connivance of Abdul Ghafoor PC, Saeed Ahmed PC and F aroosh Muhammad ASI Prison s with the escapee UTPs in manag ing and facilitat ing their escape from confinement . 19. Reappraisal of the evidence reveals that while awarding conviction and sentence u/s 223 PPC and 225 -A PPC and dismissing appeals of the Crl.

[23] Ps. No.351 -352, 438, 50 -K, 76 -77-K, 92 -K, 94 -K of 2022 - 6 - convic ts Abdul Ghafoor PC, Saeed Ahmed PC and Far oosh Muhammad ASI Prison s, the Trial Court as well as the Appellate Court have not committed any illegality or irregularity. 20. Record does not reveal of any connivance or sharing of common intention by the conv icts Ghulam Murtaza Sheikh (Superintendent Prisons), Faheem Anwar Memon (Deputy Superintendent Prisons), Abdul Rehman Sheikh (Assistant Superintendent Prisons), Naveed Ahmed Khan (Assistant Superintendent Prisons) and Salik Ayaz (Assistant Superintendent P risons) with the convicts Abdul Ghafoor PC, Saeed Ahmed PC , Faroosh Muhammad ASI Prison s and the two escapee UTPs in managing and facilitating their escape . 21.

[24] The counting of UTPs in the evening of 13.06.2017 was wrongly mentioned as correct by Abdul Gha foor PC in Register No.10/lockup report and in the early morning of 14.06.2017 , the two escapee UTPs were found missing at the time of counting the UTPs who were to be taken to the ATC Courts and the matte r was immediately brought to the notice of the high ups.

[25] Hence in such circumstances, no question arises of negligence or lack of supervision by the S uperintendent Prisons , Deputy Superintendent Prisons and Assistant Superintendent Prisons of Central Prison Karachi under Pakistan Prisons Rules, 1978. 22. According to settled principles, the factum of negligence can be taken into consideration on the basis of presumption or surrounding circumstances while taking disciplinary action against a public servant but to bring home charge in criminal proceedings against a public servant u/s 223 PPC and 225 -A PPC , definite and concrete evidence is required to prove the factum of negligence .

[26] Reference in this regard is made to the case of ‘Muhammad Yaqoob v. The State ’1. In the instant case the prosecution has fa iled to produce definite and concrete evidence to prove the negligence of Superintendent Prisons, Deputy Superintendent Prisons and Assistant Superintendent Prisons of Central Prison Karachi . 23.

[27] On reappraisal of evidence available on record it is conclud ed tha t while awarding conviction and sentence to the convicts Ghulam Murtaza Sheikh (Superintendent Prisons), Faheem Anwar Memon (Deputy Superintendent Prisons), Abdul Rehman Sheikh (Assistant Superintendent Prisons), Naveed Ahmed Khan (Assistant Superint endent Prisons), Salik Ayaz (Assistant Superintendent Prisons) and while 1 PLD 2001 SC 378 Crl.

[28] Ps. No.351 -352, 438, 50 -K, 76 -77-K, 92 -K, 94 -K of 2022 - 7 - dismissing their appeals, the Trial Court as well as the Appellate Court have erred in properly appreciating t he evidence available on record and have failed to appreciate that the pr osecution did not prove the charge against the said convicts beyond reasonable doubt.

[29] For the above reasons drawn today , vide our short order dated 21.05.2024 (reproduced herein below) , Criminal Petitions for Leave to Appeal No s: 77-K/2022 (filed by Saeed Ahmed PC), 92 -K/2022 (filed by Faroosh Muhammad ASI Prison s) and 9 4-K/2022 (filed by Abdul Ghafoor PC) were dismissed while Leave to Appeal was granted in Criminal Petitions for Leave to Appeal Nos:  (filed by Faheem Anwar Memon Deputy Superintend ent Prisons ),  (filed by Salik Ayaz Assistant Superintendent Prisons ),  (filed by Ghulam Murtaza Sheikh Superintendent Prisons ), 50-K/2022 (filed by Abdul Rehman Sheikh Assistant Superintendent Prisons ) and 76 -K/2022 (filed by Naveed Ahmed Khan Assistant Superintendent Prisons ), the same were converted into appeals and allowed . “Criminal Petitions No. 351 -352, 438, 50 -K, 76 -K of 2022 For the reasons to be recorded later, these petitions are converted into appeals and allowed.
