Prio r to the occurrence, the local police had raided the accused and as per crime report the accused suspected the deceased behind the episode , cited as motive for the crime .

[4] Trial culminated into JAIL PETITION NO. AND CRIMINAL PETITION NO .1364 -L/2013 2 conviction with penalty of death .

[6] Learned counsel for the complainant contends that without active participation/support of Riaz Ahmed respondent/co -accused, it was simply not possible for the convict to gun down the deceased and, thus, there was no occasion for the courts below to issue him a clean chit; he further argued that both the accused equally shared the motive .
