Mr. Sohail Abbas, Secretary (Jurisdiction) Mr. Abdul Salam Khan, Addl. Com. LTO. Mr. Abdul Wahid, Addl. Comm. FB R. Zahoor Ahmad, D.M.L (FDC) Muhammad Nasir, Representative of CGGC Date of hearing: 23.04.2024 ORDER Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, J. - The petitioners ha ve challenged the notification dated 05.08.2020 issued under Section 209 of the Income Tax Ordinance, 20 01 (“Ordinance”) by virtue of which Chief Commissioner Inland Revenue, Karachi was conferred the jurisdiction over LTU based in Quetta.

[19] Similarly, the Chief Commissioner LTU, Islamabad was given jurisdiction over LTU cases of Peshawar. The result of this w as that LTU cases in Quetta and Peshawar stood transferred to Karachi and Islamabad respectively. 2. During the course of proceedings, the aforesaid Notification were withdrawn vide orders passed by the Board dated 12th and 13th March, 2024, copy of which have been placed on the record, therefore, the issue in hand has come to an end.

[20] Resultantly, the titled petitions have borne fruit and are disposed of accordingly . 3. However, d uring the course of arguments, number of legal questions were raised , which we re recorded in paragraph 2 of our previous order dated 14.03.2024. During the course of arguments, it was pointed out that Section 8 of the Federal Board of Revenue Act, 2007 (“Act”) , which deals with Functions and Powers of the Board needs a revisit and r eexamination so as to clarify whether the “delegation ” in the said provision applies to the powers vested in the Board relating to all the fiscal laws, which do not provide for any such delegation in their respective laws ; secondly the delegation under Sec tion 8 of the Act has to be subject to such conditions “as it deem necessary” and no such conditions have been spelled out in the delegation notification. 4.

[21] Learned Attorney General for Pakistan frankly conceded that delegation of the powers of the Board under Section 8 to any “government agency ” or to “an employee ” of the FBR C.P. No.1178 -K of 2022, etc. 5 appears to be beyond the scope of the law and needs reconsideration. 5. It is also noticed that the Policy Board envisaged under Section 6 of the Act has not been given effect to.

[22] Further section 14 of the Act provide s for co llection and maintenance of data bank which has also not been fully established because in a number of cases before us FBR is not in a position to apprise the Court whether the FBR has filed appeal against its e arlier orders and whether the issue before the Court today stands resolved in earlier round of litigation.

[23] Such a data can expedite tax cases and can be of assistance to the courts and needs to be developed accordingly . 6. Faced with this situation, learne d Attorney General for Pakistan submits that the questions mentioned in paragraph 2 of our order dated 14.03.2024 and framed in this order will be fully addressed in the upcoming Finance Act.

[24] He further submits that as far the establishment of Policy Board is concerned, immediate steps will be taken and it is expected that the Policy Board will be fully functional shortly. 7. Therefore, as far as the main cases are concerned, the same have been disposed of as having borne fruit as the impugned notifications have been withdrawn.

[25] Let these cases now be posted in the 2nd week of July 2024 for report of the Attorney General for Pakistan regarding the concerns raised by this Court. Islamabad, 23rd April, 2024. Not approved for reporting (but to be uploaded o n the s.c. website for information) Iqbal Judge Judge Judge
