Appeals No.2,3&) Wella Aktineesellschaft (in all cases) …Appellant Versus Shamim Akhtar & others (in all cases) … Respondents For the appellant: Mr. Anwar Mansoor Khan, Sr. ASC, assisted by Mrs. Umaima Khan, Advocate. For respondent No.1: Mr.

[2] Arshad Ali Chaudhry, ASC/AOR. Respondent No.2: Ex parte. Date of hearing: 24.4.2015 JUDGMNET Anwar Zaheer Jamali, J. - These appeals, with leave of the Court in terms of the order dated 08.0 3.2007, arise out of the judgment passed in Miscellaneous Appeals No. , , , which were heard and disposed of together by the learned Single Judge in chambers of the High Court of Sindh at Karachi vide impugned judgment dated 19.04.2006, and consequently th ree orders dated 21.09.1988 , passed by the Registrar of Trademarks, Karachi (Respondent No. 2), in rectification petitions bearings numbers ,  and , were upheld.

[3] C.A No.861 of 2007, etc . 2 2. The facts leading to the present litigation may be succinctly put forth as follows. T he appellant M/s Wella Aktineesellschaft , is a company registered under the laws of the Federal Republic of Germany, who inter alia carries on the business of manufacturing and exporting cosmetic items etc.

[4] On 19.07.1971, the appellant got registered two marks, “WELLAFORM” (word) and “WELLAFLEX” (word) , bearing registration numbers 55811 and 55812, respectively. Additionally, the appellants already had the registered trademark in respect of “ WELLA with Device”, bearing registration number 8376, dated 28.09.1949 (hereinafter collectively referred to as the “ Trademarks ”).

[5] The aforesaid Trademarks were all registered under Class – 3, as being “ soap, perfumery, essential oils, cosmetics, products for cleanin g, conditioning and embellishing the hair, including hair shampoos, dry shampoos, hair lotions, hair dressing creams, hair care products, hair sprays, permanent waving solutions, bleaching preparations, neutralizing agents, hair dyes, hair colouring produc ts, hair fixing preparations, hair toning preparations, hair setting lotions ”.

[6] The appellant also duly applied for the renewal of “WELLAFORM” and “WELLAFLEX” trademarks, which were renewed up till 19.07.1993.With respect to the trademark “ WELLA with device ”, their registration was also renewed from 28.09.1986 up till 28.09.2001. C.A No.861 of 2007, etc . 3 3. The appellant , however, could not freely sell their products in Pakistan , in relation to which the se Trademarks were registered, from the year 1979 t o 1985 due to ban on the import of these products as per the Import Policy Orders 1979 -80, 1980 -81, 1981 -82, 1982 -83, 1983 -84 and 1984 -85 issued by the Ministry of Commerce, Government of Pakistan. 4.

[7] As it transpires from the record the Respondent No. 1, which is claimed to be a partnership concern carrying on the business of manufacturing and trading in cosmetics and allied products, as per their claim started using the trademark “WELLA” since the year 1984 and subsequently applied for its registration t hrough T.M.A.

[8] No. 87457 in Class -3, which application for registration met with an objection that the Trademarks of the appellant, bearing Nos. 8376 (“Wella with Device”), 55811 (“WELLAFORM”) and 55812 (“WELLAFLEX”) conflicted with the trademark “WELLA” so ught to be registered. Thus, on 09.08.1986, Respondent No. 1, filed rectification applications bearing numbers ,  and , regarding “WELLAFORM”, “WELLAFLEX” and “ WELLA with device”, respectively, before Respondent No. 2, seeking expunction of these registered Trademarks, as according to Respondent No. 1, the appellant had registered the se Trademarks without any bona fide intention to use them in relation to the goods falling in class-3 and had in fact failed to use them since their registration.

[9] C.A No.861 of 2007, etc . 4 5. In the above background, further proceedings were held before the Registrar, Trademarks, Karachi (Respondent No. 2) and through orders dated 21.09.1988, the Trademarks issued in favour of the appellant were cancelled /removed on the ground that the appellant neither used, nor took any steps to use the m, as even if import of such classified goods was banned, alternative measures, such as appointing a registered user or assigning the ir Trademarks, could have been adopted , as was being done by other foreign proprietors of trademarks under similar circumstances.

[10] It was held that in the light of extended period of non -use of these Trademarks for over five years , sufficient proof existed that the appel lant ha d no intention of using the m in Pakistan. 6. Aggrieved by the aforementioned orders of Respondent No. 2, the appellant preferred three miscellaneous appeals, under section 76 of the Trade Marks Act, 1940, before the High Court of Sindh at Karachi , which were heard and dismissed through the impugned judgment dated 19.04.2006 and, thus, the orders of the Registrar, Trade Marks, Karachi, were upheld. 7.

[11] We have heard the arguments of Mr. Anwar Mansoor Khan, learned Sr. ASC for the appellant and Mr. Ars had Ali Chaudhry, learned ASC for respondent No.1, while respondents No.2 has been proceeded ex -parte. The learned Sr. ASC for the appellant initially made reference to the leave granting order passed in these C.A No.861 of 2007, etc . 5 connected appeals, wherein , for this purpose, reference was made to the case of Cooper’s Incorporated v.

[12] Pakistan General Stores & another (1981 SCMR 1039) . On facts, his submission was twofold. Firstly, that the timeframe prescribed under section 37 (1)(b) of the Trademarks Act 1940 (hereinafter referred to as “the Act of 1940”) for deciding the issue of removal of some trademark from the Register of Trademark s on the ground of its continuous non-use for five years , was to be computed from the date within one month from the date of application, which in the instan t case were submitted by the respondent No.1 on 09.8.1986, but against it, the respondent No.2 as well as the learned Single Judge in chambers of the High Court of Sindh in their respective orders /judgment computed this period from the year 1971, which is patently contrary to the spirit of the applicable law.

[13] Disputing the findings on non-use of Registered Trademark s, he made reference to a bunch of documents to show the active use of their Registered Trademark s by the appellant Company in Pakistan during the year 1984 to 1986, which fact, according to him, brought their case out of the purview of penal consequences provided under section 37(1)(b) ( ibid).

[14] In the same context, he also laid st ress upon the use of word “bonafide” and contended that unless the Registrar could find some ulterior or malafide motive of the appellant in the purported non-use of their trademark s during the requisite period of five years upto the date of C.A No.861 of 2007, etc . 6 one month before the date of application, the said penal provision could not have been invoked against the m.

[15] In support of his next submission that it was due to continu ed ban on the import of goods of the specified classification of Registered Trademark , under the Import Policy Orders for the year 1979 -80 to 1984 -85, imposed by the Ministry of Commerce, Government of Pakistan, that the appellant were helpless to carry on the business of their registered trademark goods in class -3 in Pakistan , he also made reference to the relevant import policy orders of this period.

[16] Further, i n this context , he placed reliance upon the judgment in the case of Procter and Gamble Ltd. V. Registrar of Trade Marks (1988 CLC 252) , which lays down as under: - “From the above discussion it is quite clear that whether "special circumstance" existed in a case which justified non -user of the mark by the registered proprietor within the meaning of section 37(3) of the Act is to be decided with reference to the facts and circumstanc es of each case.

[17] The important factor however, to be kept in mind while deciding the above fact is whether the actual non -user of the trade mark resulted on account of any intention on the part of the registered proprietor to abandon the mark or on account of certain other factor which would amount to special circumstances for such non -user.

[18] Here, again, while considering the other factors, it is not merely the attendant or attached circumstance to any particular individual business which is relevant but a special circumstances of the kind which affects or applies to all the traders in that particular trade. In other words if peculiar or abnormal circumstances exist which has resulted in the non -use of the trade mark and over which the registered proprietor had no control then the requirement of section 37(3) regarding existence of special circumstance for non -use of the mark shall be deemed to have been fulfilled.

[19] It will thus be seen that if there are circumstances which make ordinary uses of C.A No.861 of 2007, etc . 7 international trade impracticable then such circumstance would amount to existence of a 'special circumstance' resulting in the non -user of the mark by the registered proprietor. In the case before me it is common case between the parties that there existed from the beg inning a complete ban on the import of detergent in Pakistan.

[20] These restrictions on the import of detergent in Pakistan are not restricted to affect the business of any particular individual but all the traders dealing in the import of detergent are affect ed by these restrictions. I am, therefore, of the view that non -use of mark by the appellant on the goods is the result of import restriction on such goods, which constituted a special circumstance within the meaning of section 37 the Trade Marks Act, and, therefore, the Registrar was not justified in ordering removal of their mark from the register.” (also see AIR 1973 Bombay 191) . 8.

[21] Conversely, Mr. Arshad Ali Chaudhry, learned ASC for respondent No.1 contended that it is an admitted posit ion from the case record that the three Registered T rademarks , regarding which respondent No.1 ha d moved application s under section 37(1)(b) (ibid) against the appellant , were registered in their favour on 28.9.1949, 19.7.1971 and 19.7.1971, respectively, but in Pakistan there was no use of these trademarks by the appellant Company throughout the subsequent period .

[22] Thus, the conclusion recorded by the respondent No.2 in his order dated 21.9.1988, as upheld by the High Court in its impugned judgment dated 19.4.2006 , is base d on proper appreciation of facts and correct interpretation of law. As regards the import policy orders issued by the Ministry of Commerce, Government of Pakistan during the year 1979 -80 to 1984 -85, neither the learned ASC disputed its genuineness nor the fact that the C.A No.861 of 2007, etc . 8 classified products of the appellant under the ir registered Trademark s squarely fell under cla ss-3 in respect of soap, perfumery, essential oils, cosmetics, products for cleaning conditioning and embellishing the hair, including hair shampoos, dry shampoos, hair lotions, hair dressing creams, hair care products, hair sprays, permanent waving solutions, bleaching preparations, neutralizing agents, hair dyes, hair colouring products, hair fixing preparations, hair toning pre parations, ha ir setting lotions etc, thus covered by the banned imposed under such import polic ies.

[23] The learned ASC when confronted with the documentary evidence showing the engagement of appellant company based in Germany in making sells and supply of their products i n Pakistan under the registered trademarks soon after lifting of ban and also making correspondence with businessmen in Pakistan for manufacturing their products under a license etc , again he could not show anything from the record to rebut these documents or the contents of the affidavit of Mr.

[24] Helmut Stollreiter, Head of the Legal Department of the appellant company dated 02.12.1986 , filed by him alongwith the objections of the appellant to the applications under section 37 (1)(b) (ibid) , moved by respondent No.1 before respondent No.2 for removal of registered trademarks of the appellant , showing that genuine efforts were made by the appellant company during the years 1984 to 1986 for securing business for their products in Pakistan .

[25] He, however, argued that as a C.A No.861 of 2007, etc . 9 bonafide businessman respondent No.1 after making honest search had started the use of the trademark “WELLA ” on his products since the year 1984 and had spent substantial amount over the promotion of his business under such trade mark , therefore, they being aggrieved person, no ulterior motive could be attributed to them in moving such applications before the respondent No.2, which were fully in conformity with relevant provisions of the Act of 1940.

[26] In support of his arguments, he referred various cases as also cited in the impugned judgment. 9. Having considered the respective submissions of the learned ASCs and scanned the material placed on record, in the first place , we deem it appropriate to reproduce hereunder the provisions of section 37 (ibid) , which read thus: - 37.

[27] Removal from register and imposition of limitations on ground of non -use: (1) Subject to the provisions of Section 33, a registered trade mark may be taken off the register in respect of any of the goods in respect of which it is registered on application in the prescribed manner by any person aggrieved to a High Court or to the R egistrar, on the ground either - (a) That the trade mark was registered wi thout any bona fide intention on the part of the applicant for registration that it should be used in relation to those goods by him or, in a case to which the provisions of Section 36 apply, by the company concerned, and that there has in fact been no bon a fide use of the trade mark in relation to those goods by any proprietor thereof for the time being C.A No.861 of 2007, etc . 10 up to a date one month before the date of the application; or (b) that up to a date one month before the date of the application, a continuous period of f ive years or longer elapsed during which the trade mark was registered and during which there was no bona fide use thereof in relation to those goods by any proprietor thereof for the time being Provided that, except where the applicant has been permitted under sub section (2) of Section 10 to register an identical or nearly resembling trade mark in respect of the goods in question or where the Tribunal is of opinion that he might properly be permitted so to register such a trade mark, the Tribunal may ref use an application made under clause (a) or clause (b) in relation to any goods, if it is shown that there has been, before the relevant date or during the relevant period, as the case may be, bona fide use of the trade mark by any proprietor thereof for t he time being in relation to goods of the same description, being goods in respect of which the trade mark is registered. (2) Where in relation to any goods in respect of which a trade mark is registered: (a) the circumstances referred to in clause (b) o f sub - section (1) are shown to exist so far as regards non - use of the trade mark in relation to goods to be sold, or otherwise traded in, in a particular place in Pakistan (otherwise than for export from Pakistan), or in relation to goods to be exported to a particular market outside Pakistan; and (b) a person has been permitted under sub -section (2) of Section 10 to register an identical or nearly resembling trade mark in respect of those goods under a registration extending to use in relation to goods to be so sold, or otherwise traded in, or in relation to goods to be so exported, or the Tribunal C.A No.861 of 2007, etc . 11 is of opinion that he might properly be permitted so to register such a trade mark, on application by that person in the prescribed manner to a High Court or t o the Registrar, the Tribunal may impose on the registration of the first mentioned trade mark such limitations as it thinks proper for securing that that registration shall cease to extend to such use. (3) An applicant shall not be entitled to rely for the purpose of clause (b) of sub -section (1) or of sub -section (2) on any non -use of a trade mark which is shown to have been due to special circumstances in the trade and not to any intention to abandon or not to use the trade mark in relation to the good s to which the application relates. ” 10.

[28] A careful reading of the above reproduced provision of law qua the scheme of the Act of 1940 reveals that it is a penal provision aimed to work as deterrent for those, seeking Registration of any trademark under the Act of 1940 with some ulterior motive , which they do not intend to use or there had been in fact no bonafide use of the ir trademark in relation to those goods for a specified period.

[29] But f or seeking the relief of removal /revo cation of a registered trademark u nder section 37(1)(b) (ibid) , specific minimum timeframe of five years ha s been provided during which there had been no bonafide use of such trademark by its proprietor , which is to be computed from a date one month before the date of application submitted by any aggrieved person in this regard.

[30] In the present case, as mentioned earlier, the three identical application s under section 37, 38 and 46 of the Act of 1940 were submitt ed by respondent No.1 for seeking removal of registered trademarks of the C.A No.861 of 2007, etc . 12 appellant on 09.8.1986, precisely , with the same assertion s that there was no bonafide use thereof from the side of appellant for a period of over five years by that time and since the year 1984 , Trademark “WELLA ” was honestly used by the respondent No.1, thus, the three registered trademarks No.8376, 55811 and 55812 in class-3 of the registered trademarks were prejudicial to their interest and liable to be removed/ cancelled. 11.

[31] As against the above claim of the respondent No.1, a detailed reply was submitted by the appellant company before the Registrar on 24.12.1986 , duly supported with the affidavit of their Legal Advisor, wherein the se allegations were strongly refuted both on law and facts on the basis of documentary evidence , which, on the one end furnish ed sufficient proof about the sincere efforts for use of Trademark s by the appellant company after lifting of ban on the import s of such classified goods by the M inistry of Commerce, Government of Pakistan, from the year 1984 -85 and before that barring the import of their goods under cla ss-3, on the basis of import policy for the year s 1979 -80 to 1984 -85.

[32] The Registrar Trademark /respondent No.2, in his orders dated 29.8.1988 seems to have totally overlooked such documentary evidence furnished by the appellant in support of their claim, so also the effect of import policy order s, which, to say the least, show that non -use of these trademark s by the appellant during the crucial period within five C.A No.861 of 2007, etc . 13 years was under special circumstances due to such legal bar and not malafide , thus, furnishe d presumption of bonafide non -use of trademark s by them during such period.

[33] If these documents which have remained unchallenged and un -rebutted, are taken into consideration then there remains no continuous period of non-use of trademark s for five years before the date of filing application by respondent No.1 for removal /revocation of trademark s of the appellant, which is a condition precedent under the relevant provision of law for pressing into service its penal consequences .

[34] As regards the other defence offered by the appellant to justify their non-use of trademark s during the period 1979 -80 to 1984 -85, i.e. the import policy orders issued by the Ministry of Commerce, Government of Pakistan, again, we find that the import polic ies for that period, cop ies whereof ha ve been placed on record, substantiated the claim of the appellant in this regard , while the ratio of judgment in the case of Cooper’s Incorporated (supra) further lend full support to their case .

[35] In this matter the Court , dealing with a case under section 10 of the Act of 1940 qua plea of acquiescence , held as under: - “As the respondent has delibe rately copied the appellant's registered trade mark, it could have succeeded before the Deputy Registrar only if it had roved honest concurrent use, of the mark 'Jockey' or "other special circumstances" within the meaning of this subse ction.

[36] But, the Deputy Registrar has given a categorical finding that the respondent had dishonestly copied the appellant's trade mark. Therefore, the first question is whether C.A No.861 of 2007, etc . 14 there is any error in this finding. 'The burden of proving an error in this fin ding was or: the respondent, but Mr.

[37] Thaker only relied on the fact that the appellant had not been able to sell its products in Pakistan, because of import restrictions. Now, although the appellant has not been selling it products in Pakistan because of i mport restrictions, this does not entitle the respondent to copy the appellant's trademark, because by doing so, it is deceiving the public into thinking that its products are the products of the appellant.

[38] And, on the ot her hand, it would appear that the respondent did not produce any evidence before the Deputy Registrar to show that its use of the mark `Jockey' was honest, therefore, as pointed out long by t he Privy Council in Subbiah v. Kumeraval (1) the fact that the respondent has copied the appellant' s mark cast on it a heavy burden' to show that its use of the appellant's mark was honest.

[39] But, as it has not produced any such evidence, it follows that it had dishonestly copied the appellant trade mark and, the High Court would not have been justified i n interfering with Deputy Registrar's finding that the respondent had dishonestly copied the appellant's trade mark. ” 12. Looking to the case of respondent No.1 for grant of requisite relief , claimed by them in their application s under section 37 of the Act of 1940, submitted before respondent No.2, it is also relevant to mention that in the year 1984 for the first time they had started using the trademark “WELLA ” for their product s under cla ss- 3, when the three registered trademark s of the appellant were already in field for a considerable long period .

[40] In such circumstances, mere assertion of respondent No.1 that adoption of such trademark was after due search undertaken by them and bonafide , is not free from serious doubt s. More so , in the circumstances w hen no material C.A No.861 of 2007, etc . 15 in support of such plea was placed on record and the trademark s of the appellant were well known and recognized internationally.

[41] It may also be added here that the burden of proof regarding the two material facts , (a) whether there was no bonafide use of the Registered Trademarks by the appellant for a continuous period of five years upto a date one month before the date of the application without any lawful excuse or special circumstances as envisaged under section 37(3) ibid, and (b) whe ther the attempt of respondent No.1 for seeking registration of word “WELLA” as their trademark was bo nafide, was squarely upon respondent No.1 , which was to be proved beyond reasonable doubt, so as to invoke its penal consequences against the appellant, but, as discussed above, they failed to discharge. 13.

[42] In addition to it, the observations of Respondent No.2, contained in his orders dated 21.9.1988, that in case of ban on goods in cla ss-3 under the import policies issued by the Ministry of Commerce, government of Pakistan for the years 1981 -82 to 1984 - 85, the appellant could have appointed some registered user under section 39 of the Act of 1940, or they could have assigned their tradema rk by invoking section 28 of the Act of 1940, or granted license to some person to avoid the penal consequences of section 37(1)(b) ibid, are equally without force as the Act of 1940 does not envisage any such compulsion to avoid the consequence of C.A No.861 of 2007, etc . 16 Governm ent ban, which could be justly and fai rly considered as special circumstances in the trade within the meaning of section 37(3) ibid and not to any intention of appellant to abandon or not to use their trademarks. 14.

[43] The upshot of above discussion is that the High Court in its impugned judgment as well as the Registrar/respondent No.2, in his order s dated 21.9.1988, wrongly invoked the provisions of section 37(1)(b) of the Act of 1940 for ordering removal of registered trademark s of the appellant. 15. Foregoing are the reasons for our short order dated 24.4.2015, passed in these appeals, which reads as under: - “Having heard the arguments of the learned ASCs for both the parties, for the reasons to follow separately, these appeals are allowed, the impugned judgment and the three orders dated 21.9.1988, passed by Respondent No.2 are set aside.

[44] Resultantly, Rectification Case s No.17, 18 and 19 of 1986 are dismissed and the registered trademarks of the appellant are restored.” Islamabad, 24th April, 2015. Approved for reporting. ﺻداﻗت Judge Judge Judge
