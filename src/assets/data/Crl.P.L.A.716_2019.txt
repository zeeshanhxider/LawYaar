[1] order dated 13.6.2019 passed by the Lahore High Court Lahore in Crl. Misc.No.14549 -B/2019 ). Husnain Mustafa …Petitioner(s) VERSUS The State and another …Respondent(s) For the Petitioner(s) : Ms. Bushra Qamar , ASC Syed Rifaqat Hussain Shah , AOR For the State : Mr. Muhammad Jaffar , D.P.G. Punjab .

[2] Akram and Tanvir , Sub-Inspectors . Date of Hearing : 12.09.2019. O R D E R Qazi Muhammad Amin Ahmed , J.- Muhammad Zain-ul-Abideen, , Kaniz Fatima,  and Muhammad Ibrahim,  were living with their mother Aneeqa Rasheed after termination of her marriage with their father Qaisar Amin , shifted at Karachi for good ; on 24 -3-2018, he learnt about homicidal death s of his children in the residential flat of his former wife; he rushed to Lahore and lodged a report wherein he blamed Aneeqa Rasheed and Husnain Mustafa, present petitioner , to have killed the children; he maintained that his former wife was carrying on with the petition er and they wanted to get rid of the children , seemingly an obstruction in their affair .

[3] As the investigation progressed, the first Investigating Officer let off the petitioner albeit with finding of his liaison with Aneeqa Rasheed; after change of investi gation, however, the petitioner alongside Aneeqa Rasheed and Ayyaz Mehmood were sent to face trial ; subsequently, the Criminal Petition No. 716 of 2019 2 complainant exonerated Aneeqa Rasheed ; she was released on bail on the basis of a concessionary statement made by no other than the complainant himself; it was subsequent thereto that she instituted a private complaint against the petitioner and Ayyaz Mehmood co -accused wherein she blamed both of them to have committed the murders within her view ; she also contradicted the case set up in the crime report by accusing the police to have collaborated with the accused ; unimpressed by the position taken by Aneeqa Rasheed, learned Additional Sessions Judge , after recording precursory evidence, dismissed the complaint vide order dated 23 -5-2019.

[4] In this backdrop, prosecution case is structured upon a positive polygraph test of the petitioner alongside statement s of Muhammad Waseem Abbas and Ali Zaib recorded as late as on 9 -7-2018; they claimed to have seen the petitioner on the crime scene in the morning of 24 -3-2018 ; the complainant arrayed Ayyaz Mudassir as privy to the cri me in supplementary statement dated 10-7-2018 . 2.

[5] Heard. 3. Brutality inflicted upon the innocent souls is most appalling to say the least , however, in the chequered circumstances of the case , what cannot be lost sight of is that the complainant, though most grievously aggrieved and devastated , nonetheless, is not eye witness of the crime ; his initial belief that the petitioner in connivance with his former wife murde red the children is essentially structured upon a suspicion; he has even recalled a substantial portion thereof while exonerating identically placed Aneeqa Rasheed before a learned Additional Sessions Judge at Lahore on 19 -12-2018 .

[6] Subsequently inducted co-accused Ayyaz Mehmood , with alleged active participation in the crime is on bail . Polygraph test, a modern forensic method to unearth the truth , may establish a person’s capacity to lie, however, findings thereof, cannot be equated with admission of guilt. Transposition of Aneeqa Rasheed as a witness with her failure to prosecute the Criminal Petition No. 716 of 2019 3 petitioner through a private complaint constitutes her departure from the scene and as such squarely bring s his case within the ambit of subsection 2 of section 497 of the Code of Criminal Procedure , 1898 .

[7] Statements of Waseem Abbbas and Ali Zaib recorded after an unexplained, inordinate delay also require evidential verification during the trial . Horrors of an heinous crime cannot impede release of accused on bail, if other wise his guilt call ed for further probe nor bail can be withheld as a strategy for punishment.

[8] The petition is converted into an appeal and allowed; petitioner shall be released on bail upon furnishing bond in the sum of Rs.500,000/ - with one surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of the learned trial Court. JUDGE Islamabad , the 12th September , 2019 Azmat /* JUDGE
