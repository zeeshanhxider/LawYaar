[3] Heard. Record perused. 3. The impugned instruments admittedly b elonged to the petitioner ; these carry a wording on the ir back as “shorty” , however, the learned counsel despite his best attempt has not been able to point out, even obliquely, any clause of contract/agreement or any portion thereof , in performance where of, the petitioner purportedly stood surety .

[4] Supported by statutory presumption of being a valid instrument, a drawer cannot ward off the consequences of its failure through bald plea of being an unsuspecting surety . Even otherwise, within the family fold in a close degree , the petitioner has not been able to point out any mala fide or animus , possibly lurking behind his long due arrest in a non-bailable/ cognizable offence , a sine qua non to diver t the usual course of criminal law.

[5] View concurr ently taken by the courts below being well within the remit of law calls for no interference. Petition fails. Leave declined. Judge Judge Judge ISLAMABAD 14th July, 2021 Azmat /* “Not approved for Reporting” Criminal Petition No.540 -L OF 2021
