[1] Order dated 02.06.2003 imposed such penalty . This Office Order of penalty was challenged by the respondent by filing Writ Petition No.2702 of 2 006 in the Lahore High Court, R awalpindi Bench , with the fo llowing prayer: a) Declare the impugned Order dated 02.06.2003 may kindly be set-aside by extending the ben efits of the Judgments mentioned above; b) Direct the respondent s to release the benefits of Voluntary Separation Scheme with 20% mark up and the petitione r may also be paid the salaries and allowances for the period from 17.01.2002 to 02.06.2003; and c) Direct the resp ondents to c alculate the benefits of VSS on the basis of last pay drawn by the petitioner ”.

[2] Although the appellant seems to have contested the said writ petition but vide judgment dated 28.10.2011 the said writ petition was allowed by granting the following relief to the respondent : “11. The ultimate inference which floats from the above discussion is that the petitioner is entitled for recovery of V.S.S. benefits.

[3] Resultantly, the instant writ petition is accepted and the respondent s are directed to pay Volu ntary Separation Scheme benefits to the petitioner. ” This judgment of the High Court was not challenged either by the appellant or the respondent. The respondent was paid benefit of VSS vide letter dated 05.01.2012, which payme nt was received by the respondent ‘under protest ’ as stated by his counsel .

[4] The respondent then filed another Writ Petition No.322 of 2012 in the Islamabad High Cour t, Islamabad , containing the following p rayer: “i) Salaries and allowances for the period f rom 17.01.2002 to 02.06 .2003; ii) VSS benefits on the basis of last pay drawn i.e. 02.06.20 03 with 20% mark up ”. This writ petition was also contested by the appel lant.

[5] After hearing learned counsel for the parties , lea rned Judge -in- Chamber s of the Islamabad High Court passed the impugned judgment dated 27.09.2012 , accepting the said writ petition and specifically directing the app ellant to comply with the judgment dated 28.1 0.2011 , in letter and s pirit. Petition for l eave to appeal 8-CA No.1257 of 2012.doc - 3 - was filed by the appell ant, in which leave was granted by this Court vide order dated 31.12.2012 . 2.

[6] We have heard learned counsel for the parties and have also gone through recor d of the case. 3. Mr. Abdul Rahim Bhatti, learned ASC for the respondent , at the outset, has contended that the appeal before this Court is not maintainable as against the impugned judgment the appellant had a remedy of filing an Intra -Court Appeal (ICA) in the High Court .

[7] He contended that without ava iling such remedy, the present appeal is liable to be dismissed. 4. Mr. Tariq Me hmood, l earned Senior ASC for the appellants , on the other hand, has opposed the submission s and contended that remedy of ICA was not available to the appellants for that under the RDFC Employees Service Regulations, 1989 , by which pe nalty was imposed upon the respondent , there was remedy of appeal and re view under Regulation No.10.7, which provides that an employee shall have the ri ght of appeal from or of making application for review of any order i mposing on him any of the p enalties and the respondent claiming these Regulations to be statutory.

[8] Thus, the remedy of ICA will stand excluded altogether to the a ppellant per secti on 3 o f the Law Reforms Ordinance, 1972 (Ordinance of 1972 ), and in this respect reliance was placed upon a judgment of five-member Bench of this Court in the case of Mst. Karim Bibi & others v. Hussain B akhsh & another [PLD 1984 SC 344]. 5.

[9] We would directl y like to examine the said judgmen t of this Court cited at the Bar by the learned Sen ior ASC for the appellant and in this regard, reference is made to para 8 there of. Relevant portion is as follows: “8. After giving our anxious consideration to the argu ments urged in sup port of this app eal we are, however, not impressed by any of the contentions raised.

[10] The test laid down by the Legislature in the proviso is that if the law applicable to the proceedings from which the Constitutional Petition arises provi des for at least o ne appeal , agai nst the original order, then no appeal would be 8-CA No.1257 of 2012.doc - 4 - competent from the order of a Single Judge in the constitutional jurisdiction to a Bench of two or more Judges of the High Court.

[11] The crucial words are the "original order". I t is clear fro m the wording of the proviso that the requirement of the availability of an appeal in the law applicable is not in relation to the impugned order in the Constitutional Petition, which may be the order passed by the lowest officer or authority in the hierar chy or an order passed by higher authorities in appeal, revision or review, if any, provided in the relevant statute.

[12] Therefore, the relevant order may not necessarily be the one which is under challenge but the test is whether the original o rder passed in the proceedings subject to an appeal under the relevant law, irrespective of the fact whether the remedy of appeal so provided was availed of or not. Apparently the meaning of the expression "original order" is the order with which the proce edings under the relevant sta tute commenced .” 6.

[13] It is admitted fact that disciplinary proceedings were conducted against the respondent under the Regulations stated above , which ultimately resulted into imposition of penalty vide Office Order dated 02.0 6.2003 , against which under the sai d Regulations , which are stated by the respondent to be statuto ry, the remedy of appeal and review is provided.

[14] We are of the view that where the proceeding s from which the writ petition has arisen provided for either re view, revision or appeal, in terms of pro viso to section 3 of the Ordinance of 1972 , remed y of ICA will not be available against the judgment passed by the learned Single Judge in the writ petition .

[15] Thus, the appeal before this Court is competent. 7. During t he co urse of arguments , it was p lainly conceded by the learned ASC for the respondent that Writ Petition No.322 of 2012 is a continuation of the proceeding under wh ich penalty was imposed upon the respondent and that the respond ent was claiming benefi t by way of implementation of the judgment passed by the High Court in the earlier Writ Petition No.2702 of 2006.

[16] Learned ASC for the respondent was then confronted wit h the question as to whether the writ petition is maintainable for obtaining implementa tion of the judgment passed by the High Court in the earlier writ petition , he, in the first place, refe rred to the provision of Article 187 (2) of the Constitution and contended that the High Court is competent to execute its own judgment under this provis ion.

[17] On reading of Article 187 of the Cons titution , it is apparent that it gives powers to the Supreme Court to issue such direction s, orders or decrees as may be necessary for doing 8-CA No.1257 of 2012.doc - 5 - complete justice in a ny case or matter pending before it , including an order for the purpose of securing the attend ance of any person or the discove ry or production of any document , while as per clause (2) thereof such directions, order or de cree shall be enforceable throughout Pakistan and shall, where it is to be executed in a Provi nce, or a territory or an area not forming part of a Province but within the jurisdiction of the High Court of the Province, be executed as if it ha d been issued by the High Court of that Province.

[18] Thus, this provision of the Constitution does not offer any help to the respondent for it deals with the execution of directions, orders and decree of the Supreme Court by High Court . The learned ASC fo r the respondent then referred to the provisio n of sub-para (i) of paragraph (c) of clause (1) of Article 199 to argue that the judgment passe d in Writ Petition No.2702 of 2006 could be enforce d through this Article of the Constitution .

[19] We have asked the learned ASC to cite any precedent but no such precedent was cite d by him before us. Thus, his second W rit Petition No.322 of 2012 was n ot maintainable before the Islamabad High Court . 8. What we understand is that pursuant to the penalty imposed upon the respondent , he filed Writ Petition No.2702 of 2006 in which the only reli ef granted to him, out of the prayer s made by him , was that of VSS be nefit be paid to him and no other prayer , contained in the said writ petition , was allowed by the High Court .

[20] The respondent neither sought review of the said judgment nor challeng ed the same before this Court rath er the judgment itself was accepted by him and the payment made to him u nder such judgment was received by him ‘under p rotest ’. Re ceiving of benefit ‘under protest ’ was o f no consequence for that the respondent admits that such payment settled his dues of VSS but the remaining dues , as was prayed by him in Writ Petition No.2202 of 2006, were not granted to him.

[21] If that be the case , the responden t ought to have taken measures for granting him other prayers containing in the earlier writ petition either by s eeking review or b y filing proceeding before th is Court , which h e did not do. The VSS benefit s having been paid to him, which were only relief allowed by the High Court vide its judgment dated 8-CA No.1257 of 2012.doc - 6 - 28.10.2011 and s ame having been accepted by the respondent , he cannot claim that full relief has not been granted to him by the appellant .

[22] Fu rther, the principle of res judicata with all its force will apply to the cas e of the respondent for that his second writ petition against the app ellant will not be maintainabl e for grantin g him the r elief, which was not allowed to him by the High Court earlier for that the law assum es that such relief st ood specifically denied to him by the High Court while passing judgm ent dated 28.10. 2011 .

[23] This being the position apparent on the re cord, after having heard learned counsel for the parties and going through the record , by short order we had allow ed the appeal and se t aside the impugned judgment dated 27.09.2012 . These are the reasons of our short orde r of even date.
