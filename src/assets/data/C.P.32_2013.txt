[2] On court query as to why the petitioner has filed the petition directly before this Court under Article 184(3) of the Constitution when he has a remedy of moving the learned High Court, petitioner submitted that he got to know about the ord er of the Election Commission when he was in Islamabad and there was not sufficient time to move the Balochistan High Court.
