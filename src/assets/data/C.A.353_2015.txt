(Judgment Reserved). …………………… CIVIL APPEALS NO. 35 3 OF 2015 AND CMA NO S. 1493 AND 2079 OF 2015 AND CIVIL APPEALS NO . 632 TO 673 OF 2017 3 J U D G M E N T EJAZ AFZAL KHAN, J. - These appeals with the leave of the Court have arisen out of the judgment dated 1 6.01.2017 of a Division Bench of the Lahore High Court whereby it dismissed the Intra Court Appeals filed by the appellants and thus uph eld the judgment dated 1 5.01.201 6 of the said High Court whereas C.

[10] A. No. 353 of 2015 has arisen out of the judgment dated 03.06.2014 of a Division Bench of the Peshawar High Court whereby it dismissed the petition filed by the appellants. 2. Learned Sr. ASC appearing on behalf of the National Bank contended that neither the letter dated 30.11.1977 issued by the Finance Division, Government of Pakistan nor the Circular No. 228(C) dated 26.12.1977 issued by the National Bank of Pakistan implementing the terms and conditions set out in the letter dated 30.11.1977 could be said to have been issued in exercise of the rule making powers under Section 20 of the Banks Nationalization Act, therefore, they have no statutory sanction behind them .

[11] He next contended that where the notification and the circular stating terms and conditions of service appear to be purely administr ative or e xecutive instructions, they cannot be treated as statutory instruments, the more so when, they have not been published in the official gazette. Whatever attire, the learned ASC maintained, the respondent may put on the notification it could not have a statutory status if seen in the light of the judgment rendered in the case of Mustafa Impex.

[12] Vs. Government of Pakistan (PLD 2016 SC 808) . He next contended that with the dissolution of Pakistan Banking Council through Banks ( Nationalization ) (Amendment ) Act XVIII of 1997 the Board of the Bank became more autonomous and independent and as such they shaped policies and determined the terms and conditions of service of their officers and executives keeping in view the emerging competitive environment .

[13] The Board, the learned Sr. ASC maintained, accordingly issued Circular No. 3799 dated 16. 06.1999 , revis ed the pay structure and the pension factor of CIVIL APPEALS NO. 35 3 OF 2015 AND CMA NO S. 1493 AND 2079 OF 2015 AND CIVIL APPEALS NO . 632 TO 673 OF 2017 4 the officers and executives of the Banks; that the circular was accepted and acted upon by the officers and the execu tives without any qualms for more than a decade; that once it was accepted and acted upon, it could not be questioned by the m under any canons of law and propriety and that neither the Single Judge hearing the writ petitions nor the Division Bench of the L ahore High Court hearing the Intra Court Appeals appreciated the content and the context of the Circular while handing down the impugned judgment s.

[14] Writ petitions of the respondents, the learned Sr. ASC argued are also hit by the principle of approbation a nd reprobation inasmuch as they damn the decrease in the pension factor without refunding what they received consequent upon the revision of the pay scale. Such petitions, the learned Sr. ASC argued, are hit by the principle of laches when they we re instit uted ten years after the issuance of the circular dated 16.6.1999.

[15] The learned Sr. ASC lastly argued that where the notification dated 30.11.1977 nor the Circular dated 26.12.1977 can be held to be statutory by any attribute, the writ petitions filed by th e respondents merited outright dismissal. The learned Sr. ASC to support his contentions placed reliance on the case of Muhammad Zaman and others.

[16] Vs. Government of Pakistan through Secretary, Finance Division (Regulation Wing), Islamabad and others (2017 SCMR 571). 3. Learned ASC appearing on behalf of the appellant in CA. No. 353 of 2015 and respondents in CA. Nos. 632 to 673 of 2017 contended that the letter dated 30.11.1977 issued by the Finance Division, Government of Pakistan and the Circular No. 22 8(C), dated 26.12.1977 issued by the National Bank of Pakistan having all the traits and trappings of statutory rules are binding on the National Bank of Pakistan, therefore, any departure from either of them would be amenable to the constitutional jurisdi ction of the High Court.

[17] The learned ASC to support his contention placed reliance on the case of Khawaja Abdul Hameed Nasir and others. Vs. National Bank of Pakistan and others (2003 SCMR 1030). Learned ASC next contended that appointment of the Pay Commi ssion for Banks and Financial CIVIL APPEALS NO. 35 3 OF 2015 AND CMA NO S. 1493 AND 2079 OF 2015 AND CIVIL APPEALS NO . 632 TO 673 OF 2017 5 Institutions, issuance of notification dated 30.11.1977 of the Finance Division, Government of Pakistan, issuance of orders by the Banking Council to the Bank and finally issuance of Circular No. 228(C), dated 26.12.1977 in compliance with the order of the Banking Council have a statutory backing, therefore, it is beyond the power and competence of the Board of Directors of the National Bank of Pakistan to change any of the terms and conditions governing the pay and pension of its officers and executives to their disadvantage.

[18] The learned ASC to support his contention placed reliance on the case of Muhammad Tariq Badar and another. Vs. National Bank of Pakistan and others (2013 SCMR 314) . The learned ASC further contended that t he notification issued by the Finance Division Government of Pakistan and Circular No. 228(C) issued by the Bank could be treated at par with the statutory rules when they have been acted upon for decades and decades together.

[19] The learned ASC t o support hi s contention placed reliance on the cases of Pakistan. Vs. Sheikh Abdul Hamid (PLD 1961 SC 105), Dr. Habibur Rahman. Vs. The West Pakistan Public Service Commission, Lahore and 4 others (PLD 1973 SC 144), Khan Faizullah Khan. Vs. Government of Pakistan thr ough the Establishment Secretary, Cabinet Secretariat and another. (PLD 1974 SC 291) .

[20] Reduction in pension factor, the learned ASC added, from 70% to 33% cannot be justified under any principle of law and jurisprudence when the recommendations of the Pay C ommission, orders of the Banking Council, notification issued by the Finance Division, Government of Pakistan and the Circular issued by the Bank no where limited their efficacy in terms of time.

[21] Failure to have the notification published in the official g azette, the learned ASC maintained, cannot shear it of its efficacy or make it non -statutory. To support his contention learned ASC placed reliance on the cases of Saghir Ahmed through legal heirs. Vs. Province of Punjab through Secretary Housing and Physi cal Planning, Lahore and others (PLD 2004 SC 261), National Bank of Pakistan.

[22] Vs. Manzoorul Hassan. (1989 SCMR 832) and Pakistan. Vs. Sheikh Abdul Hamid (PLD 1961 SC 105) . Learned ASC in the CIVIL APPEALS NO. 35 3 OF 2015 AND CMA NO S. 1493 AND 2079 OF 2015 AND CIVIL APPEALS NO . 632 TO 673 OF 2017 6 alternative argued that even if the terms and conditions regulati ng pension have their origin in a contract, the Board of Directors could not unilaterally amend them without the consent of the stakeholders.

[23] In support of his contention learned ASC placed reliance on the case of Nighat Yasmin. Vs. Pakistan International Airlines Corporation, Karachi and another (2004 SCMR 1820) . The learned ASC lastly argued that where pension is not only a vested but a recurring right, laches or any other inaction for a short span of time cannot extinguish it.

[24] The learned ASC to support his contention placed reliance on the cases of Pakistan Telecommunication Employees Trust (PTET) through M. D., Islamabad and others. Vs. Muhammad Arif and others. (2015 SCMR 147 2), Secretary, Government of Punjab, Finance Department and 269 others. Vs. M. Ismail Tayer and 269 others (2015 PLC(CS) 296), Constitution Petition No. 127 of 2012, decided on 11.04.2013 regarding Pensionary Benefits of the Judges of Superior Court (PLD 2013 SC 829), Pakistan Muslim League (N) through Khawaja Muhammad Asif, M.N.A. and others.

[25] Vs. Federation of Pakistan through Secretary Ministry of Interior and others (PLD 2007 SC 642), Pakistan Tobacco Company Ltd. and another. Vs. Federation of Pakistan through Secretary, Ministry of Commerce, Islamabad and 3 others (1999 SCMR 382 ), Civil Aviation Authority, Islamabad and others. Vs. Union of Civil Aviation Employees and another (PLD 1997 SC 781), Shahid Pervaiz.

[26] Vs. Ejaz Ahmad and others, etc. (2017 SCMR 206), Muhammad Mubeen -us-Salam and others. Vs. Federation of Pakistan through Secretary Ministry of Defence and others (PLD 2006 SC 602) and I. A. Sharwani and others. Vs. Government of Pakistan through Secretary Finance Division, Islamabad and others. (SCMR 1991 104 1). 4.

[27] We have carefully gone through the record and considere d the submissions of the learned Sr. ASC/ASCs for the parties as well as the learned DAG. 5. The background culminating in the issuance of the notification dated 30.11.1977 and the circular dated 26.12.1977 is that a CIVIL APPEALS NO. 35 3 OF 2015 AND CMA NO S. 1493 AND 2079 OF 2015 AND CIVIL APPEALS NO . 632 TO 673 OF 2017 7 Pay Commission through a resolution d ated 28.05.1977 was constituted by the Government of Pakistan with the following terms of reference: (i) To examine: - (a) the existing salary structure and all other types of allowances, amenities and facilities, including post -retirement benefits, and all such increase therein as may have been sanctioned recently, admissible to all categories of staff and employees in the nationalized banks including State Bank of Pakistan and financial institutions; (b) the principles on which they are based and the basic ter ms and conditions governing their admissibility; (c) the inter -se relationship of the salaries and allowances and other amenities, facilities and benefits and the underlying principles and justification of the same; and (d) the problems that may arise and the a djustments that may be necessary as a consequence of the scheme of merger of the nationalized banks already approved by the Government.

[28] The Federal Government following the CIVIL APPEALS NO. 35 3 OF 2015 AND CMA NO S. 1493 AND 2079 OF 2015 AND CIVIL APPEALS NO . 632 TO 673 OF 2017 8 recommendations issued the notification dated 30.11.1977 while the Bank following the notification issued circular No.2 28(c) dated 26.12.1977 . 6. What did the Banking Council stand for, what powers did it exercise and what function s did it perform under the Banks Nationalization Act before its amendment are the ques tions which have been answered by Section 9 of the Act itself which reads as under :- “9.

[29] Pakistan Banking Council. –(1).

[30] Even the President and members of an Executive Board were appointed on the recommendations of the Council.

An officer who was in non -pensionable service on 1st May, 1977 and who was entitled to the benefits of Contributory Provident Fund, shall, unless the amount of the Contributory Provident Fund has been paid be allowed to opt for the new scheme of Pension, Gratuity and Provident Fund, in lieu of the existing retirement benefits admissible to him.

[70] This option shall be exercised in writing and com municated to the competent authority within 6 months from the date of the issued of these orders. Those officers who do not exercise and communicate their options for the pensionery benefits sanctioned in this circular within the prescribed time limit, sha ll not be entitled to the benefits thereof and shall continue on their existing terms.

[71] CIVIL APPEALS NO. 35 3 OF 2015 AND CMA NO S. 1493 AND 2079 OF 2015 AND CIVIL APPEALS NO . 632 TO 673 OF 2017 15 10. Since the rates of pension and gratuity given above have been fixed by the Pay Commission for banks and financial institutions one the same lines as obtaining on t he side of the Federal Government, the existing provisions and any changes or revision in the rates or scales of pension or gratuity that may hereafter be made by the Federal Government shall also apply to the officers/executives of the Bank. 11.

[72] The exi sting schemes of Pension, Contributory Provident Fund and Gratuity shall be discontinued. Sd/- Sd/- (HUMAYUN AKHTAR ADIL) (MOHAMMAD USMAN) EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT SENIOR EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT PERSONNEL DIVISION ADMINISTRATION.” 9. A look at the notification reproduced above would show that it provided a comprehensive basis for determination of rate and scale of pension.

[73] This notification has not been termed as the one notifying the rules but it in its tone and tenor possesses all such attributes from whatever angle it is looked at . It has not been stated in the notification that it has been issued under Section 20 of the Banks Nationalization Act but the fact is that no other provision of the Act could enable the Federal Governmen t to issue a notification dealing with the matters envisaged by Section 20 of the Act.

[74] The word s used in para 1 to 10 of the notification leave no doubt that it was issue d under Section 20 of the Act. Issuance of the circular, which is almost replica of th e notification confirms its status as a statutory instrument . Para one of the notification rescind ing and replacing the existing scheme of pension, the Contributory Provident Fund and Gratuity by providing in para 1 that “the existing scheme of pension in the case of National Bank of Pakistan, the Contributory Provident Fund and Gratuity shall be discontinued” amply and overwhelmingly proves its statutory status.

[75] It would be rather unjust and even unrealistic to treat such notification as an administrative or executive instruction when it admittedly rescinded and replaced the existing scheme of Pension Contributory Provident Fund and Gratuity having their origin in the NBP’s employees Pension Provident and Gratuity Rules, 1958 made with the prior approval of the Central Government and the N.B.P. (Staff) Service Rules, 1973 made with the prior approval of the Federal Government .

[76] It cannot be looked at as a bolt from the blue either when it was preceded by an extensive spadework of the Pay Commission and succee ded by the circular dated 26.12.1977 . In this CIVIL APPEALS NO. 35 3 OF 2015 AND CMA NO S. 1493 AND 2079 OF 2015 AND CIVIL APPEALS NO . 632 TO 673 OF 2017 16 context the notification cannot be construed as an event independent of Section 20 of the Act or isolated therefrom .

[77] It also does not appear to be deficient on any score when examined in the light of the criter ia laid down in the case of Mustafa Impex. Vs. Government of Pakistan (supra) , when nothing has been brought on the record to show that any of the provisions of the Rules of Business, 1973 was ignored or violated.

[78] We, therefore, have no hesitation to hold that the notification dated 30.11.1977 having been issued by the Federal Government in terms of Section 20 of the Act is statutory in nature and violation of any of its provision s is amenable to the constitutional jurisdiction of the High Court. The case o f Muhammad Zaman and others.

[79] Vs. Government of Pakistan through Secretary, Finance Division (Regulation Wing), Islamabad and others (supra) has therefore no relevance to the case in hand. 10. Next comes the question as to what are the functions of the Board and whether the Board after the dissolution of the Pakistan Banking Council has the power to res cind , replace or repeal the notification issued by the Federal Government of Pakistan in terms of Section 20 of the Act .

[80] To answer these question s we have t o see the relevant provisions of the Act dealing with the powers of the Board. It thus reads as under : - “11. General provisions pertaining to management of banks. —(1) Subject to Subsection (2), a bank shall have a Board consisting of— (a) a President, wh o shall be its Chie f Executive ; and (b) not less than five and not more than seven other members 5[including one or more directors whose election by the private shareholders, removal and other matters shall be governed by the Companies Ordinance, 1984 (XLVII of 1984)]. (2) The Federal Government may, if it deems necessary, appoint a Chairman of the Board in respect of a bank. (3) The Chairman, the President, and other members of the Board 1[representing the Federal Government’s direct and indirect shareholding”]___ (a) sh all be appointed by the Federal Government, in consultation with the State Bank, for a term of three years, on such terms and conditions as may be fixed by the General Meeting of the bank: provided that the Chairman and the President shall be appointed from amongst professional bankers whose names are included in a panel of bankers qualified to be the Chairman or the President, CIVIL APPEALS NO. 35 3 OF 2015 AND CMA NO S. 1493 AND 2079 OF 2015 AND CIVIL APPEALS NO . 632 TO 673 OF 2017 17 which panel shall be determined, maintained and varied, from time to time, by the State Bank ; (b) may be removed for misconduct o r physical and mental incapacity before the expiry of the three years term by the Federal Government in consultation with the State Bank ; (c) shall stand removed if he becomes ineligible on any of the grounds specified in subsection (12); and (d) may be reappointed by the Federal Government, in consultation with the State Bank of Pakistan, 2[for such further term or terms as may be determined.”.] (4) The general direction and superintendence of the affairs and business of a bank, and overall policy makin g in respect of its operations, shall vest in its Board. (5) The Board shall determine — (i) the credit policies of the banks ; (ii) evaluation criteria for the performance of the employees of the bank other than the President ; (iii) personnel policies of the bank, including appointment and removal of officers and employees ; (iv) guideline s for entering into any compromise with borrowers and other customers of the bank ; and (v) any other policy matter. (6) The Chief Executive and other officers of the bank shall act in accordance with the policies, criteria and guidelines dete rmined by the Board. (7) The Board shall appoint committees from amongst the executives of the bank, and determine the powers, functions and duties of such committees. (8) Where the Federal Government has appointed a Chairman, he shall preside over the meetings of the Board, and in case a Chairman has not been appointed, then the President shall preside over the meetings of Board.

[81] In the absence of the Chairman or the President, as the case may be, the directors may elect one of the member to preside over the meetin gs. (9) The President, subject to the control and directions of the Board, shall exercise powers of management of the affairs of the bank. (10) All selections, promotions and transfer of employee of banks except the President and decisions as to their re muneration and benefits shall be made by the President in accordance with the evaluation criteria and personnel policies determined by the Board. (11) The Board, the President and other officers shall exercise their powers and discharge their duties in ac cordance with sound banking principles and prudent banking practices and shall ensure compliance with regulations and directions that may be issued by the State Bank from time to time. (12) No person shall be eligible for appointment as the Chairman, the President, or a member of the Board if — CIVIL APPEALS NO. 35 3 OF 2015 AND CMA NO S. 1493 AND 2079 OF 2015 AND CIVIL APPEALS NO . 632 TO 673 OF 2017 18 (a) he is or has at any time been adjudged insolvent or has suspended payment or has compounded with his creditors ; or (b) he is a minor or is found a lunatic or of unsound mind ; or (c) he is not citizen of Pakistan ; or (d) he was at any time in the service of the Federal Government or a corporation controlled by any such Government o r in the service of a bank and was dismissed ; or (e) he is a person against whom any action has been taken or any proceedings are pending under section 412 of the Companies Ordinance, 1984, ( XLVII of 1984 ) or section 83 of the Banking Companies Ordinance , 1962 ; (LVII of 1962 ) or (f) he is, or has been, convicted for tax evasion under any law for the time being in force ; or (g) he is a member of the Senate, National Assembly, any Provincial Assembly or an elected Member of a local council constituted u nder any law relating to local councils ; or (h) he is holding an office in a political party. ] ” 11.

[82] A careful reading of the provision s reproduced above would reveal that the Board with the dissolution of the Pakistan Banking Council became more autono mous and independent in managing the Bank and determining the terms and conditions of services of the officers and executives of the bank. It , in exercise of such powers , introduce d circular No.3799, dated 16.6.1999 revising the pay structure bringing subs tantial increase in the salaries of the officers and executives of the bank .

[83] It, however, has not been given a power by any of the provisions in general and Section 11 of the Act in particular to rescind, replace or repeal a statutory dispensation already in force. In the case of Muhammad Tariq Badr and another. Vs. National Bank of Pakistan and others (2013 SCMR 314) this Court while dealing with a similar controversy held as under : - “It is an admitted position that 1980 Rules have not been framed as per the mandate of law ibid, inasmuch as these rules are neither made by the Federal Government nor published in the, official gazette.

[84] There is also no cavil/quibble that the said rules have not been composed/enforced with the prior approval of the Governmen t or any subsequent benediction was conferred to those by the Government. Rather (admittedly) the rules have been formulated by the Board of the respondent -bank constituted under section 11 of the Act, 1974 which stipulate the general power of the Bo ard pertaining to policy making and the administration and management of the nationalized banks.

[85] Subsection (4) thereof specifically provides "The general direction and superintendence of the affairs and business of a bank, and overall policy making in respect of its operations, shall vest in its CIVIL APPEALS NO. 35 3 OF 2015 AND CMA NO S. 1493 AND 2079 OF 2015 AND CIVIL APPEALS NO . 632 TO 673 OF 2017 19 Board".

[86] Furthermore, as per subsection (5) of the Act, 1974 the Board shall determine "personal policies of the bank, including appointment and removal of officers and employees" and in accordance with subsectio n (10) "All selections, promotion and transfer of employees of banks except the President and decisions as to their remuneration and benefits shall be made by the President in accordance with the evaluation criteria and personnel polices determined by the Board".

[87] From the above it is unequivocally clear that the 1980 Rules have been framed by the Board of the bank pursuant to its authority in the nature of management/ superintendence of the affairs of the bank and/or the policy making power; however for all intents and purposes, it is so done in the exercise of an executive authority under the statute, but having even no remote or possible or permissible connection and nexus to any statutory jurisdiction, these rules thus can at best be termed, understood, c omprehended and construed merely as the guidelines or the domestic instructions of the N.B.P., for the purposes of highlighting, elucidating or beneficially revamping the service structure of bank's employees for their advantage, provided the same do not i n any manner contravene the 1973 Rules, but nothing more than that can be imputed to those; and in any case the rules do not enjoy the status of a statutory instrument. ” 12.

[88] Now a question arises where Section 20 of the Act provided that the Federal Gover nment may by notification in the official gazette, make rules to provide for all matters for which provision is necessary or expedient for the purpose of giving effect to the provisions of the Act , what would be the consequence of its failure to have it publish ed in the official gazette ? The answer to the question was given in detail in the case of SAGHIR AHMED through Legal Heirs.

[89] Vs. PROVINCE OF PUNJAB through Secretary, Housing and Physical Planning Lahore and others (PLD 2004 SC 261) in the words as fo llows: - 10. Even otherwise, the provisions of a statute for the publication or a notification in official Gazette are generally regarded by the Courts as directory and where their strict non -compliance does not provide any consequences.

[90] The legal certaint y also requires that ordinarily a statutory instrument should not be treated as invalid because of a failure on the part of public functionaries to publish it in the official Gazette. There may be many things done on the basis of such an instrument. It wou ld seem unfortunate were these things held to be invalid if it were at some stage discovered that there had been a failure by a public authority to go meticulously by the manner and mode of publication of an instrument or notification in the Official Gazet te.

[91] In the case of Multiline Associates v. Ardeshir Cowasjee and 2 others (PLD 1995 SC 423) this Court took the view that even if Karachi Building and Town Planning Regulations, 1979 were not published in the official Gazette under section 21 -A(3) of the S indh Buildings Control Ordinance, 1979, they could be construed and acted upon as regulations for the purpose of the said Ordinance.

[92] In Pakistan through Secretary, Ministry of -Defence and others v. Late Ch. Muhammad Ahsan (1991 SCMR 2180), the factual acqu isition of land had not been denied and same had been acted upon for nearly 50 years and there was an airfield in the land for such a CIVIL APPEALS NO. 35 3 OF 2015 AND CMA NO S. 1493 AND 2079 OF 2015 AND CIVIL APPEALS NO . 632 TO 673 OF 2017 20 long time.

[93] The notice/notification although had been signed and issued to all concerned but had not been gazetted. In othe r words, the purpose of the publication in the ordinary sense was practically served almost contemporaneously when the acquisition took place and in fact it was more substantial publication insofar as the owners were concerned than if it would have been in the official Gazette.

[94] It was further observed that mere fact that publication in the Gazette was delayed, would not invalidate the notification. A somewhat similar view was taken in Muhammad Siddique v. Market Committee, Tandlianwala (1983 SCMR 785). In t he case of Manzur -ul-Haq v. Controlling Authority, Local Councils, Montgomery and others (PLD 1963 SC 652) it was held, by reference to the provisions of Article 26 of the Basic Democracies Order, 1959, and section 17 of the Municipal Administration Ordina nce, 1960, that mere provision in a statute for notifying name of holder of office in Gazette was not a condition precedent to the holding of the office.

[95] In Chief Commissioner, Karachi v. Jamil Ahmed and another PLD 1961 SC 145 the Court held that the prov ision in section 280(1) of the City of Karachi Municipal Act, (1933) relating to general elections being notified in official Gazette was directory and not mandatory and a substantial compliance with that would be enough.

[96] In Regina v. Sheer Metalcraft Ltd. and another (1954 1 QB 586), Lord Streatfeild, J., took the view that "a statutory instrument, made by a Minister or other competent authority was valid and effective as soon as it was made, notwithstanding that the provisions of the Statutory Instruments Act, 1946, and the regulations, mode thereunder relating to the printing and issuing of statutory instruments had not been complied with".

[97] We, agreeing with the dictum reproduced above, reaffirm that failure to have the notification published in the offi cial gazette would not shear it off its statutory status. 13. The argument of the learned Sr. ASC for the appellant that where Circular No. 3799 dated 16.06.1999 bringing substantial increase in salaries of the officers and executives of the bank and reducing the pension factor was accepted and acted upon by the officers and the executives of the bank without any qualms for more than a decade , they could not have turned around to question it so long as they do not refund the increase in the salary , does n ot have much force firstly because the respondents never sat idl e or slept over their rights emanating from the circular dated 30.1.1977 as is evident from their correspondence at different level s and secondly because there could be no estoppel against the statute or the rules having statutory force .

[98] The argument that such petitions are also hit by the principle of laches when they were instituted more than ten years after the issuance of the circular dated 16.06.1999 is CIVIL APPEALS NO. 35 3 OF 2015 AND CMA NO S. 1493 AND 2079 OF 2015 AND CIVIL APPEALS NO . 632 TO 673 OF 2017 21 also devoid of force when the respon dents have been questioning the circular reducing the pension factor at different fora and stages .

[99] Even otherwise, the principle of laches cannot be over emphasized when pension is a recurring right as has been held in the cases of Pakistan Telecommunication Employees Trust (PTET) through M. D., Islamabad and others. Vs. Muhammad Arif and others , Secretary, Government of Punjab, Finance Department and 269 others.

[100] Vs. M. Ismail Tayer and 269 others , Constitution Petition No. 127 of 2012, decided on 11.04.2013 regarding Pensionary Benefits of the Judges of Superior Court , Pakistan Muslim League (N) through Khawaja Muhammad Asif, M.N.A. and others. Vs. Federation of Pakistan through Secretary Ministry of Interior and others , Pakistan Tobacco Company Ltd. and another.

[101] Vs. Federation of Pakistan through Secretary, Ministry of Commerce, Islamabad and 3 others , Civil Aviation Authority, Islamabad and others. Vs. Union of Civil Aviation Employees and another , Shahid Pervaiz. Vs. Ejaz Ahmad and oth ers, etc. , Muhammad Mubeen -us- Salam and others. Vs. Federation of Pakistan through Secretary Ministry of Defence and others and I.

[102] A. Sharwani and others. Vs. Government of Pakistan through Secretary Finance Division, Islamabad and others (supra ). 14. The argument of the learned ASC for the respondents that the notification issued by the Finance Division, Government of Pakistan and Circular No. 228(C) issued by the Bank could be treated at par with the statutory rules when they have been acted upon for de cades and decades together would loose its relevance and so would the judgments rendered in the cases of Pakistan.

[103] Vs. Sheikh Abdul Hamid , Dr. Habibur Rahman. Vs. The West Pakistan Public Service Commission, Lahore and 4 others , Khan Faizullah Khan. Vs. Government of Pakistan through the Establishment Secretary, Cabinet Secretariat and another (supra) , once we have held above that the notification dated 30.11.1977 having been issued by the Federal Government in terms of Section 20 of the Act is statutory in nature.

[104] CIVIL APPEALS NO. 35 3 OF 2015 AND CMA NO S. 1493 AND 2079 OF 2015 AND CIVIL APPEALS NO . 632 TO 673 OF 2017 22 15. As a sequel to what has been discussed above, we allow Civil Appeal No. 353 of 2015 alongwith the CMAs. No. 1493 and 2070 of 2015, set aside the judgment of the Peshawar High Court whereas we dismiss the Civil Appeals No. 632 to 673 of 2017 filed by the National Bank of Pakistan and maintain the judgment of the Lahore High Court , dismissing the Intra Court Appeal .
