[1] ORDER IFTIKHAR MUHAMMAD CHAUDHRY, CJ .-When we were hearing the instant case, it was informed by Major Ashfa q Ahmed B aloch, DAJAG Pakistan Rangers that vide n otification 2 dated 25th August 2011 , Ranger is also authorized to exercise powers under Section 5 of the Anti Terrorism Act, 1997 etc. He has read the contents of the notification , which indicates that to combat terr orism Ranger has been given powers especially for the Karachi City.

[2] Prima facie , it seems that Ranger is equally responsible if any incident takes place. However we direct the officer who ap peared before us that he should place on record copies of the noti fications extended fro m time to time and al so ensure that Major General Rizwan Akhtar DG Rangers attends the court at 11.30 a.m. 2.

[3] Major General Rizwan Akhtar appeared and stated that under Section 5 of the Anti Terrorism Act 1997 his force is required to prevent commission of terrorist acts or scheduled offences. It is to be noted that in the Province of Sindh Rangers is deployed from 1995 to onward to perform their duties. Whereas, w.e.f. 25th August 2011 powers of police have also been conferred upon it so that they may caus e arrest etc. of the accused persons.

[4] He also informed that at present 11000 troops of Rangers have been deployed in Karachi City and efforts are being made to prevent the terrorism . It is to be noted that in presence of considerabl e good number of troops of Rangers crime of terrorism and other offences referred to in the Schedule of the Act 1997 ha ve not been controlled or prevented despite of the fact that the Rangers has got its own system , though at a small scale , to gather secre t information s about the commission of the terrorism etc.

[5] He also admitted that regarding incident of Abbas Town dated 03.03.2013 no secret information was received by his force, except that there was generalized 3 information about the happening of the inci dent. On our query, he stated that the troops deployed near the place of incident could not reach for the assistance of the victims on account of protest launched by the inhabitants of the area and other persons who had gathered there in the meanwhile.

[6] When we enquired from him as to whether any detail of the report has been transmitted to the Secretary Interior, Government of Pakistan, he replied in affirmative and promised to place on record the report on the next date. Similarly when we enquired from hi m as to whether any action has been taken against the officials/officers failing in preventing the terrorism in Abbas Town, he stated that no such action was required to be taken because the officers , who were posted there , had been performing well in the past. 3.

[7] Be that as it may , this aspect of the case would be consider ed later on as prima facie it seems that despite of failing to prevent the commission of terrorism no effective step by initiating action against the persons posted over there had been taken by him. He is directed to submit a detailed reply about the incident of Abbas Town, dated 03.03.2013, and also explain that as to why in presence of the notification under Section 5 of the Act 1997 , Rangers had failed to prevent the commission of terrorism and other offences mentioned in the schedule , particularly when the police powers had also been conferred upon the Force for the purpose of arresting and co nducing raids to cause the arrest of the accused persons , on the next date of hearing. 4 4.

[8] Mr. Anwar Mansoor Khan , learned Sr. ASC appeared on behalf of the Provincial Government and stated that after hearing of the case , he has contacted to the Chief Minister Sindh who has communicated to him that on account of the fact that the Inspector Gene ral Police is a Grade -22 Officer, therefore, he has been surrendered to the Federal Government , similar is the situation with the DIG and the SSP will be transferred to the Headquarters and appropriate action will be taken.

[9] The l earned counsel may produce the n otification of the surrender of both these officers , i.e. IGP (Fiaz Leghari) and DIG East (Aleem Jafri) to the Federal Government during the course of the day by supply ing a copy to the Incharge Branch Registry for our perusal in Chamber. 5. It is to be noted that this Court in the case of Watan Party & another v.

[10] Federation of Pakistan and others (PLD 2011 SC 997), which is generally known as Karachi Killing and Law and Orders Case , delivered judgment on 06.10.2011, and, inter alia, observ ed as u nder: “55. It is to be noted that, primarily it is the duty of the Province through its executive authorities to control the law and order situation and ensure implementation of Fundamental Rights of citizens.

[11] But prima facie it seems that the Provincial Authorities have not fulfilled their constitutional duty. Under the Constitution, equally it is the obligation of the Federation to protect every Province against internal disturbances as well as external aggression and to ensure that the Government of ever y Province is carried on in accordance with the provisions of the Constitution.” 6.

[12] It is a matter of gr eat concern that despite of categorical observation made herein above, situation of law and 5 order has not been improved in Karachi , for which no one e lse except the Provincial Government /Executive s are responsible. The citizens/general public of Karachi constantly are being denied their fundamental rights of life and security in terms of Article 9 of the Constitution.

[13] We were hopeful that in view of the above observations situation of law and order would have been improved but here the position is altogether different. The target killings, kidnapping for ransom, Bhatta and terrorism have increased day by day. It is unfortunate that despite of happening of the instant incident and all the incidents which had been taken place earlier, no action against the responsible police officers and Rangers had been taken, may be for the reason known to the Provincial Government /high-ups of the Rangers . 7.

[14] Any way we have prima facie noticed that during the happening of the incident of Abbas Town no one from the position of the constable to I.G. P. Sindh and Rangers reached at the place of incident immediately, whereas the material/report which has been made availabl e by the Media the inhabitants of the area on their own had been helping to each other .

[15] Primarily , it was the duty of the Law Enforcing Agencies , both Police as well as Rangers , to prevent the commission of happening of such offences and if at all on accou nt of the ir negligence the incident had taken place , they could have at least extended help ing hand to the victims but they have failed to do so .

[16] Admittedly, 50 persons had lost their lives and a good number of flats and shops both situated in Iqra City an d Rabia Flower Plaza have been destroyed, peoples of the area are lying under the open 6 sky but so far administration has not moved at all in any manner as no action against any police officers or rangers had taken.

[17] We are reluctant to hold that the manner in which the incident had taken place and subsequent thereto as the Executive behaved with the victims etc. is highly unconstitutional, unlawful and illegal. Action was required to be taken immediately against the Incharge Police officers right starting fr om I.G.P. to SHO inasmuch as, SSP, DSP, etc. had not been proceeded against so far. 8.

[18] In the circumstances, we direct the Chief Secretary, Government of Sindh, being the head of the Executive that immediately suspend SSP, DSP and SHO and issue such notification during the course of the day . They also be directed to join interrogation on account of their criminal negligence in not providing the assistance to the inhabitants.

[19] The notification should be also sent for our perusal in Chamber. 9. We have been told that Mr. Iqbal Mehmood, CCPO, Karachi was also not present there and Mr. Shabbir Shaikh , Addl. IGP was holding the charge. The Chief Secretary is directed to look into his conduct as well with reference to instant case and send report to us on th e next date of hearing.

[20] If need be, we would also pass appropriate order in his case as well. 10. As DG Rangers requir es time to file the reply/explanation , therefore, this case is fixed for 08.03.2013. In the meanwhile, we would direct the Federal Gover nment through Secretary Interior as well as ISI, M.I. and I.B. to put up their reports through their counsel about happening of the 7 incident par ticularly pointing out as to whether before the incident any information was communicated to the police , Rangers and if so , then we have to examine this aspect of the case as well.

[21] However, if need be some authorized officers may also be deputed for purpose of providing assistance to the Court. . CHIEF JUSTICE JUDGE Karachi, the 06th March, 2013.
