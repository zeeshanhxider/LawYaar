[1] judgment dated 18.1.2005 of the High C ourt of Sindh , Karachi passed in CP No.D -516 of 2004 ) The Federation of Pakistan and others … Appellant s Versus M/s Delta Innovations Ltd. … Respondent For the appellant s: Dr. Farhat Zaffar , ASC . Raja M.Iqbal, ASC Mr.Asaf Fasihuddin Ver dak, ASC Raja Abdul Ghafoor, AOR.

[2] For the respondent: Mr.Tariq Javed , ASC . Date of hearing: 21.4.2015 JUDGMENT MAQBOOL BAQAR , J.- Through the above appeal the appellants have assailed the judgment dated 18.1.2006 of a learned Division Bench o f the High Court of Sindh, Kara chi whereby Constitution Petition No.D -516 of 2004, filed by the respondent, w as allowed. 2.

[3] The respondent is engaged in the business of manufactur e and assembl y of motorcycles in Pakistan. For the said purpose , he import s parts/components of motorcycles. The controversy in the matter is , as to whether the parts/ components imported by the respondent for manufactur e and assembl y of his motorcycles are amenable to custom duty @ 25% ad -voleram under PCT heading 87.14 , as clai med by the respondent, or @ 90% as prescribed under PCT heading 87.11 , as contended by the appellants. 3.

[4] The respondent ha s contended that since he imported parts/components of motorcycles that fall within PCT heading 87.14 which provides for duty @ 25% ad-voleram and d o not fall within the description of PCT heading 87.11 which provides for duty @ 90% ad -voleram , his consignments are chargeable to duty @ 25% ad -voleram only. 4.

[5] It is indeed true that parts/accessories of vehicles , including that of moto rcycles are chargeable to duty as prescribed under PCT heading 87.14 , but at the same time PCT heading 87.11, which provides for duty on motorcycles @ 90% ad -voleram , also provides for 30% exemption on such duty in respect of components for manufacturing o f motorcycles in terms of SRO No.43 6(1)/2001 dated 18.6.2001 , as follows: - “Assessable rates on account of Exemption or Regulatory Duty etc.

[6] Exemption: (a) Components for the manufacture of motorcycles falling under heading 87.11 [See S.R.O.No.436(1)/200 1, reported as PCTL 2001 St.950] 30% ad.val” And therefore, it can clearly be seen that prescription under PCT heading 87.14 is not available to parts/components imported for the manufacture/assembly of motorcycles and such consignments are amenable to duty under heading 87.11, however, with partial exemption , where the same is available in terms of SRO 436(1)/2001 , whereas the duty provided under heading 87.14 is for commercial imports only.

[7] The above arrangement/scheme as shall be discussed herein late r has been designed to encourage indigenization of the local automotive industry. 5. The re spondent, in view of the foregoing, cannot successfully claim to be falling under PCT heading 87.14 and his subject imports are clearly chargeable to duty under hea ding 87.11.

[8] He may, however, avail exemption under the aforesaid SRO upon meeting the pre -requisite therefor and if he qualif ies for the same. 6. We have noted that c ontrary to his present stance, that duty o n his import s is leviable under heading 87.14, the respondent , way back in the January 2003 , has himself applied for availing the concession/partial exemption under the aforesaid SRO, and w as in fact so keen to avail the same that he obtained an order from the learned Lahore High Court for issuance of the requisite survey certificate to enable him to avail the SRO, through writ petition No.307 of 2004 , and in pursuance of the said order , a provisional survey certificate was issued to the respondent. 7.

[9] Since, as noted above, the respondent ha s been i ssued requisite survey certificate and ha s also obtained a deletion programme in terms of the aforesaid SRO , and since the appellants have alleged violation and non -adherence to the terms of the SR O. We first need to examine the relevant aspects of the SRO and note the allegation s, before issuing any directive in the matter. 8.

[10] According to the appellants, the Government of Pakistan in order to promote indigenization of automotive industry, introduced concession ary regime through SRO No.436(1)/2001 dated 1 8.6.2001. In terms of the said SRO, and subject to certain conditions prescribed thereby , the automotive industry has been granted partial exemption in customs duty on their import of components for the vehicles manufactured by them.

[11] To avail the above con cession, the recognized assemblers has to obtain an app roved deletion programme from Engineering Development Board (EDB), which programme is devised after a survey of the manufacturing facility by the Federal Board of Revenue, whereupon a survey certificat e is issued. The exemption is granted in respect only of such components which are not manufactured locally and are imported for the manufacture of vehicles falling under PCT heading 87.11 , including motorcycles.

[12] Amongst the various conditions prescribed u nder the SRO is the condition that manufacturer shall chalk out an indigenization programme spreading over a maximum period of five years , within which period, he shall achieve such minimum indigenization of the manufacture of vehicle as approved by the in digenization committee of the EDB and that in case of any default in the indigenization programme, the components imported in violation of the indigenization programme shall attract statutory duty chargeable on the relevant CBU vehicles. 9.

[13] The appellant s, have alle ged that the respondent imported parts/components as an exempted importer and got them cleared as spare parts @ 2 5% duty, and it was only after they realized that the customs authorities are no m ore oblivious of his clan destine import of CKD ki ts, the respondent approached EDB and the FBR and applied for provision of deletion programme and the survey certificate.

[14] The respondent w as issued provisional survey certificate along deletion programme on 13.3.2004. However, instead of observing the said deletion programme , the respondent again attempted to clear his goods on lower rate of duty of 25% instead of 30% as provided under the aforesaid SRO. It is further alleged that through the consignment in question, the respondent ha s imported Main switch assembly R/L Chain, and Handle Bar Pipe upper/lower, to be used in the assembly of motorcycles and claimed assessment thereof under tariff head 87.14 which according to the appellant s is prescribed for commercial import and not for the industrial import, and that th e said consignment, if not covered under the aforesaid SRO is chargeable to duty @ 90%. 10.

[15] In the circumstances , and having already held that the parts/components being imported by the respondent are chargeable to duty under PCT heading 87.11 and that the concession under the SRO 436(1)/2001 shall only be applicable to the respondent in case he fully adhere to the terms and conditions thereof.

[16] We, feel it appropriate to remand the matter to the concerned adjudication office of the FBR to decide the same accordingly . Judge Judge Judge Islamabad the 21st April 2015 (Aamir Sh.) ‘NOT APPROVED FOR REPORTING’
