[1] judgment dated 25.10.2021 passed by the High Court of Sindh Circuit Court Hyderabad in Cr. Bail Application No.S-860 of 2021) Ameer Maviya alias Maviya and others …Petitioner (s) Versus The State …Res pondent (s) For the Petitioner (s): Mr. Manzoor Ahmed Panhwar, ASC Mr. Ghulam Rasool Mangi , AOR with petitioners.

[2] For the State : N.R. Date of hearing: 25.11.2021 . ORDER Qazi Muhammad Amin Ahmed, J. - The petitioners , accompanied by  unknown companions , armed with hatchets and pistols, allegedly mounted assault, in the backdrop of ongo ing civil litigation, as a consequence whereof, Parvez Ali and Mashooq Ali PWs , endured multiple injuries ; the incident occurred on 18.6.2021 within the precincts of Police Station Taloka Matli, District Badin ; the injured were medically examined, purporte dly under a police docket, on the same day , however, a criminal case were registered as late as on 01.09.2021, that too, on the intervention of a Justice of Peace .

[3] Petitioners’ plea of false implication and intended arrest with the stains of mala fide failed to weigh both with the Court of Session as well as the High Court of Sindh . 2. Heard. Record perused. 3. A detailed plea , argued at inordinate length, hardly merits consideration to even obliquely entertain any hypothesis of mala fide in an inciden t that presents a usual run of the mill criminal case .

[4] Statutory procedures to investigate a crime cannot be held in abeyance Criminal Petition No. 146-K of 2021 2 in a routine without grievously undermining the effective functionality of the investigative process , a step essentially to be tak en in the face of justifiably compelling considerations to thwart the process of law in aid of justice , hardly a case in hand.

[5] View concurrently taken by the Court of Session as well as the High Court, being well within the remit of law, calls for no inter ference. Petition fails. Leave declined. Chief Justice Judge Judge Karachi , the 25th November , 202 1 Azmat /-
