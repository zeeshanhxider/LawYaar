[1] ORDER IFTIKHAR MUHAMMAD CHAUDHRY, CJ .—The Secretary , Cabinet Division , Government of Pakistan, filed the requisite reply (CMA No. 2222 of 2013) in pursuance of the earlier order dated 16.04.2013 . She has explained the procedure of allocating the funds by the Prim e Minister from People s Works Programme -II (PWP -II).

[2] However, she stated that according to the budgetary provision s, an amount of Rs.22 billion (annual) was made available to the Prime Minister with an authority to sanction the amount in favour of the Parl iamentarians and Notables for the development programmes . She further stated that being the Cabinet Secretary, she is not aware about the criteria/preferences of the Prime Minister for making allocation to different development schemes, as this subject is assigned to the Special Sec retary of the Prime Minister and no sooner a Const.P.No.20 of 2013 2 sanction letter is issued, the same is processed in the Cabinet Division for onward transmission to the Account ant General Pakistan Revenues ( AGPR ) and the concerned Executing Agency.

[3] Admittedly, there is no system in place for monitoring the sanctioned funds . The AGPR is required to issue cheques to Executing Agency and then ultimately , it is only the Executing Agency , which had to monitor the execution of the development schemes. For our perusal , besides offering explanation about the expenditure s of the PWP-II funds, a copy of sanction letter as a sample has also been placed on record. 2.

[4] Prima facie , it seems that at the initial stage of sanctioning the funds from the P eoples Works Programme , no preliminary formalities were carried out about the feasibility etc. of the development programme s. It appears from the letter dated 15.04.2013, issued by Mr. Tahir Maqsood, Additional Secretary (P -I), Prime Minister’s Secretariat (Public), and the list attached therewith that on the demand of the Parliamentarian s or the “Notables ”, who some how succeeded in approaching the Prime Minister for allocation of the funds f or development from PWP , were obliged by making sanctions without following a transparent procedure nor the feasibility of the scheme for which the funds have been sanctioned was considered inasmuch as according to the list which has been furnished , not only the worthy Members of the Const.P.No.20 of 2013 3 Parliament , the Members of the Provincial Assembl ies, the “Notables ” have succeeded in getting allocation of their schemes from the Prime Minister.

[5] The Prime Minister is a person who represents the Government and the citizens , therefore, in sanctioning /allocating funds for the schemes , he is bound to fol low the high standard of transparency . In doing so for the well -being of the general public and for this purpose, a system has to be institutionalized following the recognized principles of exercising discretion judiciously.

[6] The Prime Minister, being elect ed representative, is required to follow the procedure to pro ve equitable distribution of funds for schemes without any discrimination in any manner . In the instant case , what we have noticed as former P rime Minster , Raja Pervaiz Ashraf sanctioned for himself the following amount s from time to time :- S.No.

It is informed by the Additional Secretary , Finance Division that a further sum of Rs.25 billion were allowed to be expended over and above the budgetary allocation of Rs.22 billion .

[19] Out of Rs.25 billion, Rs. 15 billion are diverted funds from the P SDP originally allocated for Diamer Basha Dam, High Education Commission, L owari Tunnel , FATA and Saving Schemes etc, (emphasis provided), whereas Rs.10 billion are three supplementary grants (Rs. 5 + Rs.3 + Rs.2 billion) , sanctioned by the Finance Division .

[20] The Secretary, Cabinet Division further stated that Rs.42.48 6 billion have already been released whereas balance amount of about Rs.4.5 billion is still available with the Cabinet Division . She informed that there were certain sanctions were made by the former Prime Minister on completion of the tenure of the Gover nment but she declined and they were not processed. 5.

[21] It may be noted that in pursuance of an article published in the daily news “Al-Akhbar ”, Islamabad, dated 25.03.2013, under the caption ﺳﺒﮑﺪوش ھﻮﻧﮯ واﻟﯽ ﺣﮑﻮﻣﺖ ﮐﯽ ﭘﺮی ﭘﻮل دھﺎﻧﺪﻟﯽ an application was registered as HRC No.11504 -G/2013, and the Secretary Planning and Development Division has filed comments by offering the following explanation s:- Const.P.No.20 of 2013 6 “Sub: REPORT IN HRC NO.11504 -G/2013 - APPLICATION : THE DAILY NEWS AL - AKHBAR, DATED 25TH MARCH, 2013, ISLAM ABAD (REGARDING CORRUPTION OF EX-GOVERNMENT The daily Al -Akhbar has reported in the editorial of its publication of 25th March, 2013 that the former Government in its last days has diverted Rs.5 b illion from important projects for the schemes of Members of National Assembly and powerful Ministers to facilitate their success in the forthcoming elections.

[22] The paper has reported that funds have been diverted from Diamer Basha Dam, Higher Education Co mmission, Lowari Tunnel, FATA, Saving Schemes along with other important projects and a total of Rs.43 billion have been provided to them (Annex -I) 2. While the contents of the newspaper clipping are not specific, these appear to allude to allocations mad e for schemes under the Peoples Works Programme -II.

[23] Allocation for Peoples Works Programme -II (PWP -II) is kept in Public Sector Development Programme (PSDP) as a block provision in the Demand of Cabinet Division. Funds from the block provision are releas ed by the Cabinet Division on the directives of the Prime Minister issued by the Prime Minister’s Secretariat to the executing agencies for implementation of schemes/projects directly without involvement of Planning and Development Division.

[24] An allocation of Rs.22 billion was kept for PWP -II in the PSDP 2012-13. 3. On a request from the Prime Minister’s Secretariat, a summary was moved by the Finance Division on 11th October, 2012, proposing provision of additional funds of Rs.10.00 billion for PWP -II during fiscal year 2012 -13. The proposal was approved by the the n Prime Minister.

[25] Pursuant to the approval of the Prime Minister, Finance Division advised Planning and Development Division on 15th October, 2012 for making necessary adjustments within the al locations of PSDP 2012 -13 while ensuring that the overall size of PSDP does not increase beyond its existing size as a result of this supplementary grant (Annex -II).

[26] Consequently, the Planning and Development Division issued adjustments letters on 6th November, 2012 and 23rd November, 2012 to allocate Rs.5 billion each (Rs.10 billion) by diverting funds from other PSDP projects, with the approval of the then Finance Minister (Annex -III, IV). 4. The above adjustments included diversion from allocations to Diamer Basha Dam, Lowari Tunnel, FATA & Higher Education Commission.

[27] However, on the request of Governor, Khyber Const.P.No.20 of 2013 7 Pakhtunkhwa, the amount of Rs.4 billion was subsequently recouped to FATA by reducing the equivalent allocation of other PSDP projects on 27th December, 2012 (Annex -V). 5. The Finance Division, after having been conveyed verbal directions for approval of additional allocation of Rs.10 billion by the then Prime Minister , moved a summary on 24th December, 2012 proposing another supplementary gran t of Rs.10 billion for PWP -II through internal adjustment in the PSDP 2012 -13 by the Planning and Development Division, which was approved by the then Prime Minister.

[28] Planning and Development Division carried out an exercise and adjusted Rs.5 billion only instead of Rs.10 billion, by reducing the allocations of other PSDP projects with the approval of the then Finance Minister (Annex -VI). As such a total Rs.15 billion was allocated to PWP -II through adjustments during the fiscal year 2012 -13. 6.

[29] In addit ion to above internal adjustment s in the PSDP 2012 -13, Finance Division has also approved an additional allocation of Rs.10 billion for PWP-II through supplementary grant, over and above the existing size of the PSDP 2012 -13. Resultantly, allocation for PW P-II increased from Rs.22 billion to Rs.47 billion.” 6.

[30] It is interesting to note that along with the report, an Office Memorandum of the Government of Pakista n, Planning Commission , Planning and Development Division, dated 06.11.2012 is appended , under the subject “SUPPLEMENTARY GRANT FOR PEOPLES WORKS PROGRAMME - II (PWP -II) WITHIN THE EXISTING SIZE OF PSDP 2012 -13”.

[31] It finds mention in the letter that the Federal Minister for Finance, Revenue and Planning & Development has been pleased to accord approval for the provision of additional funds of Rs.5.0 billion through adjustment in PSDP 2012 -13, proposed by the Planning & Development Division, to divert it to PWP -II.

[32] The approved funds would be surrendered by the concerned Ministries/Divisions in favour of Cabinet Division for Const.P.No.20 of 2013 8 PWP-II. This document is available on the file of HRC No.11504 -G of 2013 as Ann exure -II, which is hereby directed to be clubbed with the instant case . For convenience, the names of the Ministries/D ivisions, who were directed to divert the funds in favour of the Cabinet Division for PWP-II, are noted herein below: - i.

[33] States and Frontier Regions Division ; ii. Capital Administration and Development Division; iii. Communication Division; iv. Education & Training Division; v. Finance Division; vi. Higher Education Commission; vii. Interior Division; viii. Ministry of Narcotics Control; ix. Railways Division; and x. Water & Power Division (Water Sector) 7.

[34] It is true that there were saving s as the Ministry /Division indicated in t he above Memorandum but the question arises that instead of spending these amounts on any other Public Development Programme , the same have been diverted in favour of the Cabinet Division for PW P-II for the purpose of allocating /distributing these funds to the Parliamentarians and the “Notables ” knowing fully well that budgetary allocation s of Rs.22 billion under this Head has already been exhausted, therefore, prima facie inference could only be drawn that the object and the purpose was the same as has been captioned in the news item of daily “ Al-Akhbar ” noted herein above , particularly , knowing well that there is no monitoring system in stricto senso to ensure the expenditure of PWP-II funds in a transparent manner.

[35] It is also to be noted Const.P.No.20 of 2013 9 that under the New System of Financial Control and Budgeting in order to maintain the financial disciplines , certain instructions were issued from time to time to be followed including with regard to the power of sanction ing project s, etc. 8. We have also issued notice t o the Secretary Finance for the purpose of answering the question s, which have been framed in the order dated 16.04.2013, and are reproduced herein below :- i.

[36] As to whether the funds belonging to public exchequer have been allocated/distributed to MNAs/MP As/ Notables in accordance with the Constitution and the law? ii. What is the phenomenon or procedure to monitor the spending of amount and as to whether the details of such developments are available? iii.

[37] Whether the contracts were granted to the contractors by following the PPRA Rules? No reply has been filed except contending that in HRC No.11504 -G of 2013, reply was filed. The Finance Division is directed to file the reply of the above forthwith . 9. After having tak en into consideration the above - noted facts along with the viewpoint put forward by the Secretary , Cabinet Division , it is necessary to i ssue notice to the Special Secretary to the Prime Minister to submit SOPs, TORs or any instructions on the basis of which the Prime Minster is persuad ed to allocate funds from PWP-II and as to whether there is any system in place for subjecting the schemes to technical scrutiny before allocating funds or it is left for the Prime Minster to exercise h is discretion , without Const.P.No.20 of 2013 10 adhering to the Rules of Busine ss and without sanction of the Cabinet, the Prime Minister alone enjoys un fettered powers to make allocations from the programmes on the request of the public representative s, including the Members of the Provincial Assemblies and the “Notables ” and if it is so what is the justification available with the Special Secretary or the Prime Minister to accommodate any person being a representative or otherwise , etc. 10.

[38] The Accountant General Pakistan Revenues, is hereby directed to put up the details in resp ect of each development scheme , which finds mention in the list appended with letter dated 15.04.2013 , copy of which shall also be supplied to the AGPR along with the names of the Executing Agency to whom the amount s have been allocated for spending for the execution of the schemes .

[39] Similarly , each of the Executing Agency in whose favour the cheques were issued, shall submit reply through the AGPR about feasibility of the scheme and also to disclose as to whether the PPRA Rules were followed in order to ens ure transparency in the execution of the scheme s and to what extent schemes have been executed alongwith details of funds so far utilized for each scheme separately. 11.

[40] Apparently , it seems that funds were diverted from the most important projects , like Diamer Basha Dam, Higher Education Commission, Lowari Tunnel, FATA, Saving Schemes Const.P.No.20 of 2013 11 etc noted herein above to the tune of Rs.22 billion , which in fact should not have been so done because of the importance of those projects, which undoubtedly have national importance and if are completed , the same being in the interest of the economic development of the country , ultimate benefit will pass on to the whole Nation .

[41] The m anner in which the Finance Division and the Planning & Development Division ha d diverted these funds to the Cabinet Division to increase the budgetary allocation to PWP -II from Rs.22 billion also seems to be non- transparent because in such like situation, when an amount has already been spent for the purpose, the preference should have been given for completion of the projects of national importan ce, in stead of allocating this budget for execution of small schemes , which are meant only for the benefit of individuals and not for the whole Nation. 12.

[42] In view of the above, we direct the AGPR to en sure that pending decision of the instant petition the funds which have already been rel eased to the Executing Agencies, including for the schemes enumerated in the list appended with the letter dated 15.04.2013 referred to herein above are not further dis tributed and the payments in respect of the schemes, details of which have been furnished by the Prime Minister’s Secretariat shall be stopped immediately and a compliance report shall be sent to the Registrar of this Court by the AGPR for our perusal in C hamber within a period of Const.P.No.20 of 2013 12 three days, after receipt of this Order.

[43] Similarly, the Executing Agenc ies to whom the work has been assigned or the process of assigning of work is yet to be completed shall not proceed further with these schemes, till further or ders passed by this Court. Similarly, notice to the Secretary, Planning & Development Division, Government of Pakistan, be issued for filing reply of the facts and consideration which have already been noted in the order dated 16.04.2013 as well as in the instant order.

[44] Notice to the learned Attorney General for Pakistan be also issued for the next date. 13. Let this case be fixed on 30.04.2013. CJ. Islamabad J. 19.04.2013 *Hashmi * J.
