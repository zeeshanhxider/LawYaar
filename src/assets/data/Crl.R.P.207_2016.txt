[6] AND CRIMINAL ORIGINAL PETITION NO. FAISAL ARAB , J.- Petitioners in Criminal Review Petition No.  were all Sub Inspectors in BPS -14 and were performing duties in National Highway and Motorway Police (‘NH&MP’) as Patrolling Officers. Originally t hey were employees of different Police departments from all over Pakistan.

[7] After the creation of the National Highway and Motorway Police, they joined it on deputation/transfer basis. Subsequently, they were absorbed in the NH&MP . However, in compliance with the judgment of this CRIMINAL REVIEW PETITION NO. 207 OF 2016, CRIMINAL ORIGINAL PETITION NO. 62 OF 2016, CRIMINAL M.A.

[8] NO. 1758 OF 2016, CRIMINA L M.A. NO. 86 OF 2017, CRIMINAL M.A. NO. 87 OF 2017, CRIMINAL M.A. NO. 404 OF 2017, CRIMINAL ORIGINAL PETITION NO. 22 OF 2017, CRIMINAL ORIGINAL PETITION NO. 69 OF 2017 AND CRIMINAL M.A. NO. 1521 OF 2016 3 Court reported in the case of contempt proceedings against Chief Secretary, Sindh etc (2013 SCMR 1752), NH&MP withdrew/cancelled the absorption/induction of the petitioners in its establishment and repatriated them to their respective parent departments on the ground that their induction in NH&MP was without the recomme ndations of the Departmental Induction Committee.

[9] The petitioners had also approached Islamabad High Court against the order of NH&MP by filing ICAs wherein stay was initially granted but subsequently, in the light of the order passed by this Court in Crim inal Original Petition No.  dated 10.05.2016 , whereby it was observed that the High Court could not exercise its jurisdiction in relation to the matters pertaining to the terms and conditions of service of civil servants in view of the bar contained under Article 212(3) of the Constitution , the said ICAs were dismissed.

[10] Hence, the petitioners have come before us to review the judgment of this Court passed in Criminal Original Petition No.  etc. 2. In Criminal Original Petition No.  , the petitioners were civil employees of different government departments. After the inception of NH&MP , they joined it on deputation/transfer basis.

[11] Subsequently, they were absorbed in the NH&MP , however, in compliance with the judgment of this Court report ed in contempt proceedings against Chief Secretary, Sindh etc (2013 SCMR 1752), the NH&MP withdrew the absorption/induction of the petitioners in its establishment and repatriated them to their parent departments.

[12] Hence, they have filed this contempt petit ion on the ground that the respondent Authority has misinterpreted the judgment of this Court as it was applicable only to the employees of the province of Sindh. CRIMINAL REVIEW PETITION NO. 207 OF 2016, CRIMINAL ORIGINAL PETITION NO. 62 OF 2016, CRIMINAL M.A.

[13] NO. 1758 OF 2016, CRIMINA L M.A. NO. 86 OF 2017, CRIMINAL M.A. NO. 87 OF 2017, CRIMINAL M.A. NO. 404 OF 2017, CRIMINAL ORIGINAL PETITION NO. 22 OF 2017, CRIMINAL ORIGINAL PETITION NO. 69 OF 2017 AND CRIMINAL M.A. NO. 1521 OF 2016 4 3. The case of the petitioners in Criminal Original Petitions No.  &  is that they were directly appointed employees of NH&MP ; that most of the officials were hired from different departments and the petitioners are deprived of thei r legitimate right of seniority and that most of the deputationists lacked the requisite qualificatio n and experience.

[14] According to them this Court in the above said judgment has cancelled all absorptions/appointments by transfer and deputations but the department has partially implemented the said judgment . Hence, they pray that contempt of court proceed ings be initiated against the respondent Authority. 4. So far as the case of the petitioners in Criminal Review Petition No.  is concerned, we have perused the judgment under review .

[15] The respondent Department on the recommendation of the Departme ntal Committee has repatriated the petitioners on the ground that their induction was without the recommendations of the Departmental Induction Committee , which to our mind is unexceptionable. No ground for review is made out. Criminal Review Petition No.  is accordingly dismissed. 5.

[16] So far as the case of the petitioners in Criminal Original Petition Nos.  &  that they are regular employees of NH&MP and the process of absorption of several employees is illegal and has affected the s eniority of regular employees is concerned, it would be appropriate to refer to our order dated 16.01.2017 passed in Civil Appeal Nos. 709 to 717 of 2016 etc in which an almost a similar question was raised .

[17] Appellants of those appeals, who were working in different Police organizations, were initially appointed on deputation basis in CRIMINAL REVIEW PETITION NO. 207 OF 2016, CRIMINAL ORIGINAL PETITION NO. 62 OF 2016, CRIMINAL M.A. NO. 1758 OF 2016, CRIMINA L M.A. NO. 86 OF 2017, CRIMINAL M.A. NO. 87 OF 2017, CRIMINAL M.A.

[18] NO. 404 OF 2017, CRIMINAL ORIGINAL PETITION NO. 22 OF 2017, CRIMINAL ORIGINAL PETITION NO. 69 OF 2017 AND CRIMINAL M.A. NO. 1521 OF 2016 6 order of this Court is ve ry much clear and it will include all those employees also who were originally inducted in NH&MP from BPS - 1 to BPS -7 but later promoted to higher scales .

[19] The respondent Department is directed to strictly follow this principle. So far as the plea that judgm ent of this Court passed in Criminal Original Petition No.  etc was only meant for civil servants of the province of Sindh is concerned, suffice it is to state that in the said judgment this Court has settled the fate of all employees who were sent on deputation, therefore, this principle can be uniformly applied in similar cases as well in rest of the provinces as well .

[20] With the above observation s, this contempt petition is disposed of. CRIMINAL M.A. NO s. , , ,  & 152  8. In view of the order passed in the connected Criminal Review Petition No .  , Criminal Original Petition Nos . ,  and  , these miscellaneous applications have become infructuous and are disposed of accordingly.
