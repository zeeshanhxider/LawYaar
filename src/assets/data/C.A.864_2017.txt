[11] The Ministry has observed that Divisional Superintendents have C.A.No. etc 6 regularized the services of the TLA Staff against the instructions issued for regularization of the employees engaged after cut of date. In this context, attention is invited to this office letters No.831 - E/132 -XV(E.Policy) Dated 04.08.1999 and 28.08.1999 wherein it was categorically directed that services of adhoc employees and substitutes appointed upto 26.12.1992 who meet the laid down conditions for regularization of adhoc and subs titute employees only on the Pakistan Railways be regularized through duly constituted selection committees no such instructions for regularization of the services of TLA staff have been issued by this office.

[12] The competent authority has, therefore, direc ted that regularization of such staff employed after cut off date may be withdrawn. Ministry has also requested the Director/Vigilance for investigation of such cases where irregularity of regularization of ineligible staff was committed by the Divisions a nd submit report within one month.

[17] Subject: REGULARIZATION OF CONTRACTUAL AND DAILY WAGE WORKERS . I am directed to refer t o this Ministry’s letter of even number dated 18 -01-2012 on the above subject under which following eligibility criteria as per direction of the Cabinet Committee on regularization of Contractual and Daily Wage Workers has been circulated.

[18] Accordingly, emp loyees meeting the eligibility criteria should be regularized with immediate effect as per following procedure already notified on 18 -01- 2012. (reproduced below) A) “Contractual Employees: C.A.No. etc 8 All contractual employees who have completed at least one year of uni nterrupted contractual appointment as on December 31, 2011 are to be regularized except the following: i.

[19] Contractual employees working against project posts; ii. Contractual employees working against posts that are to be filled through the Federal Public Service Commission, and iii. Contractual employees who do not possess the prescribed qualifications and eligibility criteria for the posts they have been appointed against.

[20] B) Daily Wage Workers All daily wage workers who have completed three consecutive terms of ap pointment of 89 days each as on December 31, 2011 are to be regularized with im mediate effect except the following: i. Employees working against project posts ii. Employees, if any, working against posts that are to be filled through the Federal Public Service Commission, and iii.

[21] Employees who do not possess the prescribed qualifications and eligibility criteria for the posts they have been appointed against. 2. Orders of the competent authority should first be obtained for creation of posts to absorb employees to be regularized. Necessary action should please be taken immediately and a compliance report be submitted to the Ministry within 14 days positively. 3.

[22] Details of all contractual or daily wage employees not meeting the yardstick for regularization should be conveyed to this Ministry on the enclosed proforma within three week positively. C.A.No. etc 9 4. Case of contractual/daily wage employees working against regular posts to be filled through the Federal Public Service Commission should be dispatched to the Ministry on case -to-case bases with complete justification for regularization.

[23] It must also be ensured that no contractual or daily -wage employee who has crossed the date of superannuation is regularized. 5. The preceding instructions apply to all posts in BS-1 to BS -17 only.” 2. All previous instructions/guidelines issued by this Ministry on the subject issue may be treated as superseded. 3.

[24] It is reiterated that all cases of regularization of Contractual and Daily Wage Workers may be finalized on emergent basis and a fin al report in the matter must be furnished to this Ministry within one week, positively. 4. This issues with the approval of competent authority. Sd/- (GULZAR MUHAMMAD) Director Establishment ” 3.

[25] Perusal of the above policies reveals that in 1985 all the workers who were appointed on adhoc basis or as substitute s against permanent posts for more than one year were absorbed on regular basis and their services were regularized from the date of their initial appointment to the posts. Thereafter, in the year 2 000, it was reiterated that the applicability of Regularization Policy, 1985 was restricted to adhoc employees and s ubstitutes appointed up to 26.12 .1992 .

[26] As the respondents were admittedly appointed in the years , Regularization Policy, 1985 was not applicable to them. 4. Thereafter, a fresh Regularization Policy was introduced in the year 2008 , which was for the first time applicable C.A.No. etc 10 to temporary staff and required that the staff must have completed three years of service as TLA by 08.09.2007 , when they were to be considered for regularization which would take effect from the date of the policy .

[27] This policy with a cut -off date of 08.09.2007 was not applicable to the respondents who were appointed in  and had not completed three years of ser vice by 08.09.2007 . Finally , Regularization Policy 2012, inter alia , provided for the regularization of daily -wage workers who had completed three consecutive terms of appointment of 89 days as on 31.12.2011 to be regularized with immediate effect.

[28] Pakista n Railways regularized the services of the daily -wagers/TLAs appointed in the years  under this policy with immediate effect. The said policy also provided in paragraph -2 that all previous instructions/ guidelines issued by the Ministry on the sub ject may be treated as having been superseded. 5.

[29] The respondents were time and again asked to identify the Regularization Policy under which they seek regularization from the date of initial appointment. Their response has been largely evasive and have unco nvincingly pointed toward s the Regularization Policy, 1985 in support of their claim . It appears that respondents were not fully aware that the Regularization Policy of the year 1985 was modified and the said policy was restricted to the appointments of ad hoc employe es and substitutes appointed upto 26.12.1992 , as reaffirmed i n Regularization Policy, 2000 (above) .

[30] It is also important to point out that the said policy did not strictly provide for regularization of daily -wagers or TLAs . Thereafter , the Regul arization Policy for the year 2008 is also not C.A.No. etc 11 applicable to the current respondents as they were appointed in  and in order to avail the benefit of Regularization Policy, 2008 they had to complete three years of service by 08.09.2007 if they were to be considered for regularization under the policy .

[31] Therefore, the only policy available in the field which was applicable to the facts of the respondents was Regularization Policy, 2012 under which the respondents have already been regularized by the a ppellant . As the said policy is with immediate effect i.e., 20.02.2012 , the respondents cannot claim the regularization from the date of initial appointment. 6.

[32] Learned counsel for the respondents tried to refer to general case law on regularization but coul d not cite a precedent that has discussed the above Regularization Policies announced or approved by Pakistan Railways . 7. We, therefore, find no illegality in the regularization of the respo ndents under Regularization Policy, 2012 from the date of regulariz ation i.e., 20.02.2012.

[33] The impugned judgment is not sustainable and is, therefore, set aside. 8. For the above reasons, t he listed appeals are allowed , whereas the listed petitions are converted into appeals and allowed accordingly. 9. In the end we wish to po int out that during the course of hearing, we have noticed that Pakistan Railways could have dealt with this matter more ably and it is only after summoning the Chief Executive Officer and the Human Resource Head of Pakistan Railways that we are able to underst and the scheme of the Regularization Policies .

[34] We hope that, in future , the Chief C.A.No. etc 12 Executive Officer will improve the quality of governance at Pakistan Railways so that such like litigation can be avoided or minimized . Islamabad, 08th October, 20 19 Not approved for reporting. Sadaqat Judge Judge
