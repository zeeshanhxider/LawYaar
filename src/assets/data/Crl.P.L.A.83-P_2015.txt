[1] judgment dated 06.03.2015 passed by the Peshawar High Court Pe shawar in Cr. A. No. 188-M/201 2) State through AG General KP, Peshawar …Petitioner (s) Versus Sabz Ali Khan …Res pondent (s) For the Petitioner (s): Ms. Abida Safdar, Assistant Advocate General, KPK For the Respondent(s) : N.R. Date of hearing: 26.07.2021 ORDER Qazi Muhammad Amin Ahmed , J.- Indicted for homicide for committing Qatl-i-Amd of Sher Muhammad, within the precincts of Police Station Changlay, District Bonair, the respondent was convicted under clause (b) of section 30 2 of the Pakistan Penal Code, 1860 by a learned Additional Sessions Judge vide judgment dated 10.10.2012 ; he was sentenced to death with a direction to pay compensation to the legal heirs of the deceased; on the coordinate charge of murderous assault on Mushtaq PW, he was sentenced to 7 -years RI with concomitant monetary compensation ; the High Court acquitted him from the charges vide impugned judgment dated 06.03.2015 , vires whereof, are being assailed on the ground s that there was no occasion for the High Court to take the impugned view inasmuch as the prosecution had successfully driven home charge beyond a shadow of doubt on the strength of ocular account furnished by the witnesses that included an injured with a massive injury .

[2] It is next argued that investigative conclusions drawn up pursuant to a prompt recourse to law, inexorably pointed towards respondent’s culpability , singularly arrayed in the crime report . According to the learned counsel, reference by the High Court to peripheral issues and state d durations of time are Criminal Petition No. 83-P/2015 2 too trivial to override the preponderance of evidence that unambiguously excluded every hypothesis other than respondent’s guilt; simi larly, according to her , stated lapses on part of the Investigating Officer , being inconsequential , certainly does not cast away prosecution ’s case , otherwise firmly structured on evidence furnished by the independent witnesses and, thus, the impugned view being artificial warrants interference by the Court in order to avoid miscarriage of justice .

[3] Con tentions merit consideration ; leave is granted to reappraise entire evidence with a view to secure the ends of justice. Send for the respondent through bailable warrants in the sum of Rs.200,000/ -, returnable to the Assistant Registrar of this Court at Peshawar . Station House Officer shall execute the warrants within a fortnight.
