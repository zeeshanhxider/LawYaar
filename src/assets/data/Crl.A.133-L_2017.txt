[1] judgment dated 09.02.2015 passed by the Lahore High Court, Lahore in Crimina l Appeal No.381 of 2012 and CSR No.7-T of 2012 ). Shaukat Ali …Appellant(s) VERSUS The State , etc. …Respondent(s) For the Appellant(s) : Mian Subah Sadiq Klasso n, ASC For the State : Mr. Mazhar Sh er Awan, Additional Prosecutor General , Punjab Date of Hearing : 16.05.2019 JUDGMENT Qazi Muhammad Amin Ahmed , J.- Through leave of the Court , impugned herein is judgment dated 9.2.2015 of a learned division bench of Lahore High Court whereby appellant’s conviction and sentence returned by a learned Anti Terrorism Court vide judgment dated 23.2.2012 is maintained . 2.

[2] Naveed alias Guddu , hereinafter referred to as the deceased, left home after receipt of a phone call at 7.30 p.m. on 22.8.2011 . Upon failure to return, his disappearance wa s reported by his brother , Muhammad Rafiq ue, PW-7. On 25.8.2011 , the family received a phone call, demanding ransom of Rs.500,000/ - in pursuance whereto the witnesses went to the designated place where they saw t he appellant who decamped from the scene .

[3] The incident wa s reported to the police in consequence whereof the appellant was arrested on 26.8.2011 and upon his disclosure dead body of the abductee was retrieved, wrapped in a jute bag . It is in this backdrop that the appellant alongside Shahzad, co -accused were indicted before the Court ; third accused Nadeem Hussain is Criminal Appe al No.13 3-L of 2017 . 2 still away from law .

[4] The learned Trial Judge while acquitting Shahzad co -accused from the charge convicted the appellant under Sections 201, 30 2(b), 365 -A of Pakistan Penal Code, 1860 read with Section 7(e) of Anti Terrorism Act, 1997 ; he was sentenced to death on three counts along with five years R.I. under Section 302 of the Code ibid with fine of Rs.5,000/ - or to undergo four months S.I. in l ieu thereof . 3.

[5] Muhammad Rafiq ue, PW-7, Muhammad She hbaz, PW- 9 and Fida Muhammad , PW-10 are prominent amongst the witnesses to drive home the charge . They have furnished details preceding as well as subsequent to deceas ed’s disappearance. The investi gating officer also collected cell phone data to establish conversation s between the captor and the family.

[6] However, prosecution’s reliance is primarily upon appellant’s confessional statement dated 16.9.2011 before a judicial magistrate . It constitutes the mainstay. 4. Though the appellant when indicted claimed trial and retracted from his confessional statement during his examination under Section 342 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 , nonetheless , on a careful examination we have found his confessio nal statement free from all taints .

[7] Seemingly voluntary without duress or inducement ; inculpatory in nature the confessional statement reflects a complete and truthful narration of event leading to deceased’s death . The learned Magistrate has taken due car e to administer necessary warning s to the appellant and recorded each detail thereof in his own hand.

[8] It does not appear to have been fabricated to advance prosecution’s case and thus can be squarely relied upon without any reflection on safe administratio n of criminal justice. It is by now well settled that a retracted confession can form basis for conviction if found voluntary and truthful . Retraction notwithstanding when examined in the totality of circumstances, the disclosure is synchronized with the e vents leading towards deceased’s death and recovery of dead body on appellant’s disclosure.

[9] These circumstances exclude every hypothesis of his innocence and thus the Courts below have rightly relied u pon the confessional statement, there being no Criminal Appe al No.13 3-L of 2017 . 3 space to entertain any hypothesis of innocence. Guilty verdict calls for no interference ; the appeal fails.

[10] However, in so far as question of quantum of sentence to be exacted from the appellant is concerned it requires reconsideration; in the totality of circumst ances , it is unmi stakably found that predominant purpose behind the crime was to extract ransom and it was in that process that the deceased lost his life due to suffocation and tranquilizer , excessively administered to subdue him ; taken from this angle , alteration of death penalty into imprisonment for life on each count would be a conscionable wage in circumstances .

[11] Consequently, penalty of death is altered into imprisonment for life on each count with amounts of fine and compensation kept intact; senten ces shall run concurrently with benefit of Section 382 -B of the Code ibid. With the above modification, Criminal Appeal 133 - L/2017 is dismissed . JUDGE JUDGE Lahore , the 16th of May, 2019 Ghulam Raza /* JUDGE
