[1] order dated 06.03.2015 passed by the Lahore High Court , Multan Bench , Multa n, in W.P.Nos.1712 & 5133 of 2014 ] Chief Executive MEPCO & others [in both cases ] …Petitioner (s) VERSUS Muhammad Fazil, etc [in both cases ] …Respondent( s) For the Petitioner (s) [in both cases] : Rao Muhammad Iqbal, ASC Ms.

[2] Tasnee m Amin, AO R (absent ) For Respondent No.1 [in both cases] : Mr. Asad Munir, ASC Ch. Akhtar Ali, AOR Date of Hearing : 18.04.2019 JUDGMENT GULZAR AHMED , J.— The respondent Muhammad Fazil , in both petitions, was employed as an Assistant Line man (BS-5) by the petitioner on 16.09.200 0 on one-year contract.

[3] This contract ual employment of the respondent was extended from time to time . The President Sports MEPCO wrote a letter to the Executive Engineer /Deputy Manager to spare the respondent from duty for cricket practice and he wa s accordingly spared from duty and it was done from time to time . On 18.07.2005 , SDO/Assistant Manager w rote letter to the respo ndent to join duty but the respondent instead filed an application for medical leave for 112- days, from 29.06 .2005 to 18.10.2005.

[4] This application for medical leave apparently was not accepted by the petitioner s and ultimately the respondent joined s ervice on 16.02.2007 whe n he was dismissed from service for being absent without sanctioned leave. The respondent thereafter served grievance not ice on the C.P.Nos.866 & 867 -L of 2015.doc - 2 - petitioner s and then filed grievance petition in the Punjab Labour Court No.9, Multan ( Labour Court ).

[5] This pet ition was opposed by the petitioner s. After hearing the matter , learned Labour Court vide its judgmen t dated 04.09.2013 accepted the re spondent’s grievance petition and set aside order of his dismissal but at the same time directed hold ing of inquiry against the respondent. Back benefits were not allowed by the Labour Court.

[6] The respondent challenged this judgment by filing Labour Appeal No.MN-1096 of 2013 before the Punjab Labour App ellate Tribunal No.2, Multan (the Tribunal ) with the prayer that he be reinstated with full back benefits and the order of holding inquiry be set aside . The Tribu nal vide i ts judgment dated 09.12.2013 came to the conc lusion that the Labour Court ought to have passed order of reinstatement of the respondent and allowed the petitioner s to hold de novo inqui ry but as no de novo inquiry was held by the m in term s of the order of the Labour Court, the respondent ’s appeal was allowed by setting aside order dated 04.09.2013 directing the petitioner s to reinstate the respondent in service but without back benefits.

[7] Against the judgment dated 09.12.2013 of the Tribunal , both the petit ioner s and respondent filed writ petitions in th e Lahore High Cour t, Multan Bench . The petitioner s in its Writ Petition No.1712 of 2014 sought setting aside of judgment of the Tribunal and dismiss al of the grievance petition.

[8] However, the respondent in his Writ Petition No .5133 of 2014 prayed for settin g aside of the ju dgment of the Tribunal to the extent where it ha d refused him the grant of back benefits. Both these writ petitions were heard by a learned Judge in Chamber of the High Court and vide comm on impugned order dated 06.03.2015 the same were disposed of by mod ifying judgment of the Tribunal by extending all back benefits to the respondent.

[9] The petitioner s were, however , allowed to initiate fresh proceedin g, if so , authorized by law. Both these petitions for leave to appeal have been filed agains t the said impugn ed order. 2. It is contended by Rao Muhammad Iqbal, learned ASC for the petitioner s that both the Labour Court as well as the Tribunal have concur rently passed order not allowing ba ck C.P.Nos.866 & 867 -L of 2015.doc - 3 - benefits to the responde nt in exercise of their juris diction vested under the law and the High Court while exercising writ jurisdictio n under Article 199 of t he Constitution was not competent to upset such concurrent judgments and in this respect relied upon the case of Muhammad Tufail v.

[10] Divisional Forest O fficer, Forest Division, Lahore & 3 others [1990 SCMR 1708] and Syed Kamaluddin A hmad v. Federal Service Tribunal & others [1992 SCMR 1348]. 3. On the other hand, Mr. Asad Munir, learned ASC for the respondent has contended that the High Court while dea ling with the Con stitution Petition under Article 199 of the Constitution has exe rcised its discretion in favour of the respondent by granting him back benefits and further the High Court has also fou nd that the respondent was on sanctioned leave and on th is ground justifi ed grant of back benefits to the respondent. 4.

[11] We have heard learned counsel for the parties and have also gone through the record of the case. 5. We are cognizant that both the Labour Court and the Tribunal in their respective judgments have not allowed back benefits t o the respondent and we under stand that such deci sion of the two Courts below was mainly based upon the fact that the respondent though alleges to have made applica tion for leave bu t without obtaining i ts approval went on leave and thus wilfully absented himself.

[12] The respondent ’s counsel has relied upon the leave application of the respondent filed at page 27 of CMA No.1933 of 2019 , which is a form of application co ntaining name of the respondent where he sought medical leave with effect from 29.06.2005 to 18.10.20 05 (112 -days) which seems to have been recommended by the Assistant Manager (Operation) but ultimately there is no order passed by the competent authority sanctioning this l eave.

[13] We also note that this applica tion is even not signed by the respondent as his signature does not appea r on the application form. Apart from this document which obviously show s that there was no sanction of leave , the responde nt on his own admissio n states that he has joined service after availing leave on 16.02.2007 which is ment ioned in the judgment of the Labour Court to be the C.P.Nos.866 & 867 -L of 2015.doc - 4 - date on which he came to report for duty after availing leave.

[14] We are unable to understand how the leave wh ich responde nt has initially clai med from 29.06.2005 to 18.10.2005 (112 -days) c ame to be extende d up to 16.02. 2007 for neither the respondent has explained this position in his grievance petition nor the La bour Court has adverted to this issue and similarly the Tribun al and the High Court have also omitted to consider the same.

[15] Be that as it may, th ere was no san ction of leave to the respondent by the petitioner and there is no material on record to show that even the leave from 29.0 6.2005 to 18.10 .2005 was at all san ctioned to the respon dent. The respondent ’s very app lication for g rant of leave was not signed by him and it also does not contain the order of the competent authority sanctioning the sa me.

[16] Thus, what appears to us is that the responden t has remained abs ent from dut y not only for the period for which he so ught leave but be yond that period, therefore, the High Court in its impugned order dated 06.03.2015 was not justified to hold that the responden t has remained on sanctioned leave .

[17] The learned ASC for the respondent has further contended that the only principle on which back benefits could be denied to the respondent is his gainful employment between the period of his dismissal from servi ce to his reinstatemen t and t here being no evidenc e available on the recor d showing that he was gainfu lly employ ed, back benefits could not be refused to him .

[18] In this respect he has made refere nce to the case of Sohail Ahmed Usmani v. Director General Pakistan Civil Aviation Aut hority & another [2014 SCMR 1843] . It is true that in the cited judgment this Court has allowed bac k benefits on the ground that the employee was not gainfully employed du ring the period of his dismissal up to his reinstatement .

[19] However, the employee being gainfu lly employed or not while remaining out of service has not always been a reason for granting or non -granting of back be nefits rather it has been held by this Court in a number of cases that where the Court concerned reinstate s the employee in service , it is not boun d to gr ant back benefits automatically rather it is within the disc retion of that Cour t to grant back benefits or not and exercise of such discretion could not be interfered with by the High C.P.Nos.866 & 867 -L of 2015.doc - 5 - Court in exercise of writ jurisdiction unless it is shown that such discretion has been exercise d without law ful authority and is of no legal effect .

[20] Such discretion has not been interfered with by the superior forum. In thi s regard, reference is made to th e cases of Abdul Majid v. Chairman, WAPDA & 2 others [1990 SCMR 1458] , Muhammad Tufail v . Divisional Forest Officer, Forest Division, Lahore & 3 others [1990 SCMR 1708] , Humayun Badshah v. Habib Bank Li mited & 3 others [1996 SCMR 1606] and Syed Kamaluddi n Ahmed v.

[21] Federal Service Tribunal & others [1992 SCMR 1348] . The further principle is that where the Court or the Tribunal has jurisdiction and it determin es specific question of fac t or even of law, unless patent legal defect or material irregu larity is pointed out, such determination cannot ordinar ily be interfered with by the High Court while exercising jurisdiction under Article 199 of the Constitution .

[22] The very facts of the case amply demonstrate that the respondent himself was liable for being proce eded against by the department for that he remained on un sanctioned l eave not only for the period he applied in the purported app lication but also beyond that period. Both the Labour Court and the Tr ibunal having exercised discretion in not granting back benefits to the respondent , such exercise of discretion could n ot be found to be without lawful authority and of no legal effect .

[23] Thus, the impugned order of the High Court cannot be su stained in the eye of law being in excess of the jurisdiction vested in it, which is liable to be set aside. We, therefore, convert this petition in to an appeal and partly allow the same by s etting aside the impugned order dated 06.03.2015 to the extent o f granting back benefits to the respondent .
