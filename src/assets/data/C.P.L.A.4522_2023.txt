[2] Secretary Mr. M. Arshad, DG Law Mr. Falak Sher, Legal Consultant For Respondent s 1 & 2 : Syed Sikandar Hayat Shah, ASC (via video link from Peshawar) Date of Hearing: 02.01.2024 ORDER Qazi Faez Isa, CJ. The Election Commission of Pakistan (‘ECP’) has filed this petition against an ad-interim ex -parte order of the Peshawar High Court dated 27 December 2023, whereby a learned single Judge had suspended the notification dated 25 December 2023 of the ECP through which the returning officer of a constituency was changed .

[3] It is submitted that the returning officer was changed on medical ground and on his own request , and referred to the attached medical certificate and the application of the said returning officer requesting that in view of his ill health he c annot undertake the assigned responsibili ties. Accordingly, it is submitted that for justifiable reason, the ECP had changed the returning officer . 2.

[4] The respondents No.1 and 2 have entered appearance through learned Syed Sikandar Hayat Shah . We enquired from learned counsel CP  2 as to why the said respondents had filed the petition before the High Court assailing the change of the returning officer and how were they aggrieved with the chan ge of the returning officer, but did not receive any satisfactory answer from him .

[5] He however stated that scrutiny of the said respondents’ nomination papers has not taken place . 3. Learned Mr. Afnan Karim Kundi representing the ECP states that it is on a ccount of their own acts that the scrutiny of nomination paper s, scheduled to take place on 28 December 2023 , could not take place because the said respondents had the notification suspended on 27 December 2023 and there was no returning officer to scrutin ize the nomination papers .

[6] He however submits that if the impugned order is set aside , the ECP shall ensure that the scrutiny of nomination papers of the said respondents and the other candidates, whose scrutiny of nomination papers in respect of the Provi ncial constituency (PK-91 Kohat -II) that could not take place on account of the ad-interim ex - parte order will be under taken as per the following schedule: PK-91 KOHAT -II SL.

[7] NO. EVENTS NOTIFIED DATE REVISED DATE 4. Last date for Scrutiny of nomi nation papers by the Returning Officer 25.12.2023 to 30.12.2023 05.01.2024 5. Last date for filing of appeals against decisions of the Retuning Officer rejecting/accepting the nomination papers. 03.01.2024 09.01.2024 6. Last date for deciding of appeals by the Appellate Tribunal 10.01.2024 16.01.2024 7.

[8] Publication of revised list of candidates 11.01.2024 17.01.2024 8. Last date for withdrawal of candidature and publication of revised list of candidates 12.01.2024 18.01.2024 9. Allotment of election sy mbols to contesting candidates 13.0.2024 19.01.2024 4. We are satisfied that the ECP, for justifiable reasons , had issued the notification substituting the returning officer.

[9] I t is also the responsibility of the ECP to conduct election s. Moreover, no al legation against the newly appointed returning officer was made . Therefore, it cannot be stated that the exercise of discretion by the ECP was in any manner illegal or unconstitutional. It is also of concern that an ad- interim ex -parte order was passed by the learned Judge of the High CP  3 Court without issuance of notice to or hearing the ECP ; which would adversely affect the election programme and jeopardi se the election s to be held in the said constituency. 5.

[10] Under the circumstances , we set aside the impug ned order dated 27 December 2023 by converting this petition into an appeal and allow ing the same and by dismissing Writ Petition No.6194 - P/2023 filed in the Peshawar High Court. However, since the stipulated date for the scrutiny of nomination papers of c andidates could not be completed on account of the said ad-interim ex -parte order , we direct that the scrutiny of the nomination papers of candidates, including the said respondents , whose scrutiny of nomination papers has not taken place be undertaken as per the given fresh schedule reproduced above. 6.

[11] This petition is converted into an appeal and allowed in the said terms. Chief Justice Judge Judge Islamabad 2nd January 2024 Mudassar / Approved for Reporting
