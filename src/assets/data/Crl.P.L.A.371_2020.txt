[9] However, a learned Div ision Bench of the High Court of Sindh , while altering conviction of Ahmad Omar Sheikh under section 362 of the Code ibid with sentence of 7 -years rigorous acquitted the respondents from the remainder charges vide impugned judgment dated 02.04.2020 , vires whereof, are being a ssailed by the State through C riminal Petition No s.371, 372 & 373 of 2020 ; parents of the deceased also questioned the impugned acquittals through Criminal Misc.

[11] It is next argued that various incriminating pieces of evidence established , both through physical as well as scientific means , constituted uninterrupted / continuous chain that inexorably linked the deceased with the respondents and their absconding colleagues ; according to him, forensic evidence , generated without any possibility of human interference, conclusively proved the homicidal death subsequent to deceased’s abduction, a charge upheld by the High Court itself , for purposes having strong nexus with terrorism and, thus, acquittal from the coordinate charges was not a possible option through any mode of appraisal of evidence .

[15] Recovery of digital apparatus i.e. laptop, scanner, polaroid as well as zoom cameras, used by the accused to communicate with the deceased’ s family, established a continuous chain of circumstances unmist akably pointed upon the culpability of the accused, additionally reinforced by the confessional statement s of the two accused, leaving no space for the High Court to entertain any hypothesis other than respondents’ guilt , concluded the learned counsel .

[16] Mr. Faisal Siddiqi, ASC, while appearing on behalf of deceased’s parents , reiterated most of the submissions earlier addressed ; he additionally argued that sentence awarded to Ahmad Omar Sheikh under a penal provision though cited erroneously as section 36 2 of the Code ibid, nonetheless, irresistibly suggested that the High Court , being convinced about the abduction of the deceased, had convicted and sentenced the respondent on the said charge , driven home through various pieces of evidence that equally encompassed the concomitant conclusion of the crime and as such the impugned view was not only self-destructive but impossible as well and, thus, warrants interference to avoid miscarriage of justice. 4.
