[1] order of Islamabad High Court, Islamabad date d 26.07.2019 passed in WP No. ) Federal Board of Revenue thr. its Chairman, Islamabad & others ... Petitioners Versus M/s Hub Power Company Ltd & others ... Respondents For the Petitioners: (Through V.L. Karachi Registry) Ms. S hazia Bilal, ASC Syed Salauddin Gillani, Addl.

[2] Commissioner For Respondent No.1 : Mr. Jahanzeb Awan, ASC Date of Hearing: 20.01.2023 ORDER Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, J. - The le arned counsel for the respondent, at the very outset, raised an objection that the petitioners have filed the instant petition without exhaustin g the available remedy of filing an Intra Court Appeal (“ ICA”) under section 3 of the Law Reforms Ordinance, 1972 (“Ordinance ”) before the High Court, therefore, the instant petition is not maintainable.

[3] In support of this contention, the learned counsel has placed reliance on Col. (Retd .) M.R. Hassan1, Mst. Karim Bibi2, Samina Masood3, Zia Mohy -ud-Din4, Ilyas Gujjar5 and Abdul Ghani6. 1 Col. (Retd.) M.R. Hassan v. SHO Margalla, Islamabad,1998 SCMR 2738. 2 Mst. Karim Bibi v. Hussain Bakhsh, PLD 1984 SC 344. 3 PIAC v.

[4] Samina Masood , PLD 2005 SC 831 . 4 Accountant General for Pakistan v. Zia Mohy -ud-Din, PLD 2008 SC 164. 5 Ch. Muhammad Ilyas Gujjar v. Chief Election Commissioner, PLD 2011 SC 961. 6 FBR v. Abdul Ghani, 2021 SCMR 1154. C.P. No. 3739 of 20 19. 2 2. On the other hand, the learned counsel for the petitioners has also relied on Media Network7 to contend that the instant petition is maintainable. 3.

[5] We have heard the learned counsel for the parties and have gone through the case law with their able assistance. It is settled law that wh ere the right t o file an ICA before the High Court under section 3 of the Ordinance exists , then a petition before this Court without exhausting the said remedy, and thereby circum venting the forum below, is ordinarily not maintainable.8 The requirement of filing an ICA is a rule of practice for regulating the procedure of the Court and does not oust or abridge the constitutional jurisdiction of this Court.9 Such petitions , however, have been entertained by this Court only when certain exceptional circumstances exist, such as, where the matter involves important questions of law of great public importance having far -reaching consequences10, questions of law as to the interpretation of the Constitution11 and validity of provincial statutes12, and substantial questions of law i nvolving fundamental rights13, coupled with the fact that the objection with regards to maintainability is taken at a belated stage before the Court .14 We note that no such exceptional circumstances exist in the matter at hand and the objection regarding maintainability of the petition was also duly raised at the first instance.

[6] Reliance on Media Network (supra) by the learned counsel for the petitioners is misconceived as in the said judgment, this Court had noted that the objection as to maintainability was taken at a belated stage and important questions of law of great public importance having far -reaching 7 Commissioner of Income Tax v.

[9] Manzoor Hussain, 1992 SCMR 441. 14 PTCL v. Iqbal Nasir, PLD 2011 SC 132; Commissioner of Income Tax v. Messrs Media Network, PLD 2006 SC 787. C.P. No. 3739 of 20 19. 3 consequences were involved in terms of selection of cases for audit under a Self -Assessment Scheme and policy guidelines issued by the Central Board of Revenue .

[10] Whereas, the present matter relates simply to adjustment of input tax with respect to services received by the respondent against the sales tax on services . Consequently , we find that the instant petition, having been filed without availing the re medy of an ICA before the High Court, is not maintainable. 4.

[11] In the light of the above, the preliminary objection raised by the learned counsel for the respondents is upheld an d the instant petition is accordingly dismissed being not maintainable. Islamabad, 20th January, 2023. Approved for reporting Iqbal Judge Judge Judge
