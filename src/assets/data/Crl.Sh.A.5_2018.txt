The appellant and co -convict Afzal challenged their conviction and sentence by filing appeals before Fe deral Shariat Court. Trial Court also forwarded Murder Reference No.02/I of 2016 for confirmation or otherwise of the death sentence of the appellant. 5.

[10] While answering Murder Reference No.02/I of 2016 in affirmative , the appeals filed by the appellant a nd co -convict were dismissed by the Federal Shariat Court vide common judgment dated 7 M arch 2017. The appellant challenged his conviction and sentence by filing Jail Shariat Petition No. 01(S) of 2018 .

[11] The appellant was granted leave to appeal vide order dated 25 September 2018 to reappraise the entire evidence available on record for safe administration of criminal justice. 6. At the very outset, learned counsel for the appellant stated that he is not press ing the instant appeal for acquittal of the appellant and is pressing the same to reduce the death sentence of the appellant to imprisonment for life u/s 302(b) PPC and to make all the sentences of the appellant to run concurrently with benefit of section 382 -B Cr.P.C. on the grounds that co-convic t Afzal had abetted the appellant for committing the offence, he had shared common intention with the appellant in commission of the offence and being vicariously liable for the same , he has been awarded lesser sentence of life imprisonment u/s 302 (b) PP C, the confessional statement of the appellant is not corroborated by the medico legal evidence, the medico legal evidence is also lacking corroborat ion due to recovery of one crime empty. 7.

[12] Learned Additional Advocate General, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa strongly opposed the reduction of the sentence of the appellant from death to imprisonment for life u/s 302 (b) PPC on the ground s that the case of co -convict Afzal is distinguishable as vital shot was fired upon the deceased by the appellant , the appellant was cau ght with pistol, the crime empty recovered from the place of occurrence was found matching with the pistol by the firearm expert, the appellant has confessed his guilt in his confessional statement recorded u/s 164 Cr.P.C. which is corroborated by circumst antial evidence . 8.

[13] After hearing learned counsel for the appellant and the learned Additional Advocate General, KPK , we have perused the available record which reveals that the Crl. Sh. A. No.05 of 201 8 3 co-convict Afzal had ab etted the appellant for committing the offence, the Suzuki Carry Van was hired/booked by the co-convict Afzal from Pinnian and the appellant was picked on the way near Kharooch barrier .

[14] The c o-convict Afzal made search of the driver and he snatched Rs.300/ - and one Nokea mobile from the driver . He demanded more money from the driver but the driver had no cash. When they tried to snatch the Suzuki C arry Van, the driver stopped the vehicle near a populat ed area. Due to apprehen sion of their arrest , the appellant made a fire upon the driver and they both started running towards hills but the people and police chased and they were apprehended . 9.

[15] According to the confessional statement of the appellant recorded u/s 164 Cr.P.C. , he fire d once upon the deceased and only one crime empty was recovered from the place o f occurrence , which was from within the said vehicle, therefore, if he had repeated the fire such e mpty would also have been found .

[16] There are precedents of the Supreme Court that firing only on ce from a firearm is a mitigating factor attracting the alterna te sentence of imprisonment for life. Moreover in his confessional statement the appellant had stated that co-convict Afzal persuaded and abet ted the appellant for commission of the offence and had fully participated in the crime with the appellant.

[17] It is settled law that either a confessional statement is accepted in its entirety or discarded, therefore, if it contains something beneficial to the appellant that cannot be discarded . Having shared common intention with the appellant , the co -convict Afzal was vicariously liable for the offence , however he has been awarded the lesser sentence of imprisonment for life u/s 302(b) PPC while the appellant has been awarded death sentence. 10.

[18] Considering all the above as mitigating circumstances, while maintaining the conviction of the appellant under section 302(b) PPC , his sentence of death is reduced to imprisonment for life . The amount of compensation to be paid to the legal heirs of the deceased and the period to undergo in default thereof is maintained.

[19] The co nviction and sentence of the appellant u nder section 392 PPC and 13 A.O. are also maintained. All sentences to run concurrently and benefit of section 382 -B Cr.P.C. is extended to the appellant. The appeal is partly allowed in the above terms.
