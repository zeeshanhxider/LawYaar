[1] ORDER Qazi Muhammad Amin Ahmed, J. Raja Farhat Iqbal, applicant herein, accused in a case of homicide, was acquitted by the trial Court; High Court of Sindh, however, reversed the findings and while returning a guilty verdict, sentenced him to imprisonment for life , vide judgment dated 28.12.2005, vires whereof were challenged through an appeal; the complainant dissatisfied with the quantum of sentence came up with a petition for enhancemen t of sentence, however, without success .

[2] It was on 25 -3-2009 when applicantâ€™s learned counsel opted to withdraw the appeal, consequently dismissed ; his subsequent attempt to seek a review of dismissal of his appeal failed on 12.3.2019 ; his failure s, notwithstanding, he was released on parole way back on 24.1.2015 and it was one of the reasons that weighed with the Court to decline the review .

[3] The applicant has approached in person once again and was joined by Mr. Ghulam Sajjad Gopang, ASC during the proceedings ; they are aggrieved by the office refusal to entertain their application on the Cr. M.A. No.1404 of 2019 2 ground that after dismissal of earlier review petition , there was no occasion to entertain the request and it is in this backdrop that the present application (Cr.M .A.

[4] No.1404 of 2019) has been posted before us . 2. Dismissal of review petition foreclosed avenues for subsequent attempt s by the applicant and for that law is well settled by now. The applicant cannot escape the consequences of course adopted by his duly engaged counsel merely on the ground that he had not so instructed him, that too so late in the day.

[5] Being hopelessly misconceived, the instant application is dismissed. Judge Judge Judge Islamabad , the 15th October , 2019 Azmat /-
