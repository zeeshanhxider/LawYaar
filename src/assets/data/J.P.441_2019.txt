[8] The petitioner being aggrieved filed a Writ Petition No.l357-P of 2019 before the High Court, which was disposed of by the High Court vide order dated 21.03.2019 granting him permission to file an appeal in the light of an earlier No.. Relying on this, the petitioner filed a Criminal Appeal NO.283-P of 2019 under Section 408 of Cr.P.C. before the High Court, however, this appeal along with two other appeals filed by consolidated judgment dated 31.05.2019.

[9] Hence this petition for leave to appeal. We have heard the learned counsel for the petitioner 4. as well Pakhtunkhwa and have also gone through the available record. The present case pertains to an incident that allegedly 5. occurred within the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA) and was adjudicated under the judicial framework provided by the FCR.

[10] The petitioner was convicted under Regulation  of the FCR by the Court of APA vide its order dated 24.08.2017. The record of the case further reveals that the petitioner did not avail any of the remedies available to him under the FCR i.e. appeals to the Commissioner and a revision to the Tribunal. However, when he failed to do so, he filed a constitutional petition under Article 199 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (the Constitution) before the High Court on 25.03.2019, after a considerable delay of more than one and a half years from the date of his conviction.as the learned Additional Advocate General, Khyberother convicts was dismissed by the High Court through ajudgment of the same High Court rendered in Reference -4-6-Jail Petition No.44l of 2019 ♦ » It is by now well settled that where a particular statute/law provides a self-contained mechanism and well defined forum of redressal for the determination of questions of law or facts by way of an appeal or revision to another authority or Tribunal as the be, the same has to be followed being the remedy case may provided under the law.

[11] The petitioner without exhausting such constitutional the allowed invoke be to remedies cannot jurisdiction of the High Court. Furthermore, the writ jurisdiction of the High Court cannot be exploited as the sole solution when there under the law, These cannot be bypassed to invoke the writ jurisdiction.

[12] Even otherwise, the extraordinary jurisdiction of the 6. High Court under Article 199 of the Constitution cannot be reduced to an ordinary jurisdiction of the High Court.

[14] Muhammad AZAM and others (PLD 2024 SC 838). It is, however, true that in certain cases, resort to the Constitutionalthis regard may be made to the cases of Mian Muhammad Yousafare equally effective and adequate alternate remedies provided 6-Jall Peiitioii No.44l of 2019 -5- 1 . jurisdiction of the High Court instead of availing the remedy provided under the statute may be justified, but is available on record of this case for ignoring the remedy provided under the FCR.

[15] In light of the above, we have no hesitation to observe that the petitioner failed to avail the legal remedies available to him provided under the ECR in a timely manner and remained in a deep slumber for a long time. Being so, the order dated 24.08.2017 of the APA, Central Kurram, Sadda convicting him attained finality.

[16] However, he subsequently approached the High Court under its constitutional jurisdiction, and that too after aids the vigilant, not the indolent. Therefore, the petitioner's invocation of the constitutional jurisdiction is not permissible under the law and cannot be accorded any credence in the matter before us. 7. arguments, frankly acknowledged the above legal position but adopted another stance, asserting that the petitioner, after the disposal of his writ petition, filed an appeal under Section 408 of the Cr.P.C. before the High Court on special permission granted by the High Court in light of an earlier judgment in Reference No.l-P of 2019; but the same was unfortunately dismissed by the High Court through the impugned judgment on the ground of limitation.

[17] It was further submitted that the Court of APA, Central Kurram, Sadda, failed to comply with the mandatory provisions of the ECR and did not afford the petitioner a fair trial, thereby causing serious prejudice to him. Despite this, the learned High Court,no such material a considerable delay. It is a settled principle of law that the law The learned counsel for the petitioner, during -6- 6-Jail Petition No.44! of 2019 while dismissing his appeal, did not consider this significant 8. plausible explanation by the petitioner for the inordinate delay in filing the appeal, either in the memorandum of appeal or through a separate application for condonation of delay under Section 5 of The petitioner was convicted and sentenced in the year 2017, and he had the opportunity to challenge his conviction before the proper forum, but he failed to do so.

[18] In these circumstances, the High Court was fully justified in dismissing the appeal on the ground of limitation. Besides the above, the law on the subject is very much clear. The remedies under the FCR have been provided as discussed above. No Court of has always been held to be a statutory right. The judgment in Reference No.l-P/2019, as argued, is not before us nor, it has been argued and established that the law point involved in the Reference was similar to the one involved in this case.

[19] When the law has not provided any right of appeal before the High Court then the High Court itself cannot assume the said jurisdiction. If such a jurisdiction is exercised, then that would be nothing but nullity in the eye of law and coram non judice. Hence, no basis for interfering with the impugned judgment of the High Court arises.

[20] Coming to the other important plea of the petitioner 9.aspect of the matter and dismissed the appeal in a casual manner. on the basis of some decision of the High Court. The right of appeal or legality of the order passed by thethat this Court as well as the High Court now has the jurisdiction to examine the viresWe have carefully considered that there was no its own offer or provide a special permission for filing of an appealthe Limitation Act, 1908. -7 - 6-J ail Petition No,44l of 2019 authorities under the FCR on the grounds that Article 247, which bars their jurisdiction, had been omitted through the Constitution Constitution (the 2018 Amendment) Act, (Twenty-fifth Amendment).

[21] This stance of the petitioner is not legally tenable. This is because the order against the petitioner was passed by the FATA Tribunal on 05.04,2017, whereas the Amendment Act received the assent of the President on 31.05.2018 and was published in the Gazette of Pakistan on 05.06.2018, approximately than a year after the order dated 24.08.2017 of the more Additional District Magistrate/Assistant Political Agent, Central Kurram, Sadda.

[22] A retrospective effect cannot be given to this Constitutional Amendment, nor was there any such intention by this decided prior Otherwise, the legislature. to matters Constitutional Amendment would also need to be reviewed by the Constitutional Courts, which would open floodgate to any case, at the time when the order against the petitioner was made.

[23] The Article 247 was very much in the field and the jurisdiction of the High Court was barred in matters exclusively dealt with by the FATA hierarchy, which had attained finality and were correctly upheld by the High Court in the impugned judgment. For the above mentioned reasons, this petition being 10. meritless is dismissed and leave is refused.
