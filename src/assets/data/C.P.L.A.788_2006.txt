[1] judgment da ted 5.6.2006 passed by Lahore High Court, Rawalpindi Bench. 2. Learned counsel stated that in view of the judgment in the case of Federation of Pakistan th rough Secretary Education Vs. Pr.Dr. Anwar and two others (2006 SCMR 382) the pe titioner is entitled for hearing before the competent authority by way of submitti ng his reply.

[2] In this behalf it may be noted that a larger Bench of this Court earlier delivered a judgment in the case of Federation of Pakistan Vs. Muhammad Tariq Pirzada and two others (1999 SCMR 2744) a nd settled that hearing before Section Officer is sufficien t. Relying upon the same judgment, learned High Court had obs erved that hearing before Section Officer will meet the requirements of Article 32 Order PO(1) 1983. 2.

[3] We are inclined to agree with the judgment delivered by a larger Bench comparing the judgment which has been relied upon by the CP 788 of 2006 2 learned counsel, therefore, the earlier view taken in Tariq Pirzadaâ€™s case(ibid) is approved and petition is dismissed holding that the High Court had rightly declined to interfere in the impugned order following the law laid down in the judg ment delivered by a larger Bench of this Court.

[4] Petition is dismisse d and leave declined. Chief Justice Judge Judge Islamabad, the 14th September, 2006 Nisar/* APPROVED FOR REPORTING
