[4] Islamabad. Mr. Ayaz Swati, Addl.A.G Balochistan. Date s of hearing: 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, 12th and 14th April, 2016. ORDER Arguments in these connected appeals were heard on several dates of h earing, during which, on 12.4.2016, some suggestions were also exchanged between the learned ASC s for the appellant and respondents CA-, etc 2 No.1, 3 and 9.

[5] In response to it, following written formulations have been sent today by Dr. Muhammad Farogh Nas eem, learned ASC. “Formulation and Written Arguments on behalf of MQM and PML(F). Further to write -up dated 6.4.2016 and the Addendum dated 7.4.2016 the Respondents are filing the present 2nd Addendum. 2.

[6] The undersigned appears on behalf of MQM and PML(F), whose instructions are as follows: - a) with regard to the issue of youth seats, neither MQM nor PML(F) filed any petition in the High Court and hence they are not aggrieved on this issue. b) with regard to women seats, both MQM and PML(F) are also neutral with regar d to the percentage of the seats. 3.

[7] Both MQM and PML(F) are of the considered view that all indirect elections in the Local government elections, whether they pertain to Mayors, Deputy Mayors , Chairmen and Vice Chairmen should be conducted through secret ballot and not through show of hands. Also no bureaucratic transfer should be made by the government except upon permission from the ECP, after the announcement of the elections. 4.

[8] The distinction attempted to be brought about by the Appellant that the in direct elections for Mayors, Deputy Mayors, Chairmen and Vice Chairmen are separate elections is incorrect. All elections to the Local Government are part and parcel of each other, as one leads to another. It is settled law that election starts from the fi rst step and includes all subsequent steps till the culmination.

[9] Hence, the law which was applicable on the first date of the announcement of elections i.e. 25.8.2015 (reference is invited to para 4 of the undersigned’s first write - up) will be applicable r ight till the end when the elections of Mayors, Deputy Mayors, Chairmen and Vice Chairmen so also the reserved seats would culminate.” 2.

[10] After hearing the learned ASCs for the parties at length , for the reasons to be recorded separately, these appeals are partly allowed in the following terms: - (i) The amendment brought into effect by the Province of Sindh vide Sindh Local Government (Third Amendment) Act, 2015 (Sindh Act No.XXXVIII of 2015 ) with effect from 25.8.2015, as regards introduction of 05 percent reserved seats for “Youth ” and increase in the number of reserved seats for women from 22 percent to 33 percent, is held to be validly legislated; thus, to remain operative.

[11] CA-, etc 3 (ii) With the consent of the appellant and respondents No.1, 3 & 9, all the reser ved seats as prescribed under section 18 shall be filled up in terms of section 18A of the Sindh Local Government Act, 2013 , which will be revived and such amendment will be brought into effect by the appellant immediately .

[12] In case requisite legislative am endment is not made within two weeks, these seats shall be filled up in the manner as otherwise prescribed by law . (iii) The elections for the posts of Mayor, Deputy Mayor, Chairm an and Vice Chairm an are to be held under the Constitution and the law i.e. the Sindh Local Government Act, 2013 , therefore, it is within the competence of the Sindh Government to legislate law to hold such elections either through show of hand s or secret ballot.

[13] However, in the present case, since such amendment has been brought i nto effect under section 18 (ibid) on 18.1.2016, after the announcement of Election Schedule on 26.8.2015 , therefore, such amendment is of no legal effect, and as per the Sindh Act No.XXXVIII of 2015 , the ensuing elections for these posts will be held thro ugh secret ballot. (iv) All notifications regarding transfers and posting of bureaucrats issued by the appellant after the date of announcement of Election Schedule for Sindh Local Bodies i.e. 30.5.2015, without prior approval from Respondent No.6, the Ele ction Commission of Pakistan , are declared to be without jurisdiction and of no legal effect. (v) The Election Commission of Pakistan shall ensure completion of remaining election process of local bodies in Sindh for the reserved seats as well as for the o ffice of Mayor, CA-, etc 4 Deputy Mayor, Chairman and Vice Chairman within 60 days from today. 3.

[14] The impugned judgment of the High Court is accordingly modified in the above terms. 4. A copy of this order be sent through Fax to the Secretary, Election Commission o f Pakistan ; Chief Secretary, Government of Sindh, and other concerned authorities for their information and compliance. Announced. Islamabad, 15th April , 2016.
