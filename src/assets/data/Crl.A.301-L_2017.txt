Akbar Ali Shad, ASC For the State : (without caveat ) Ch. Muhammad Mustafa, DPG Date of Hearing : 26.6.2019. JUDGMENT Qazi Muhammad Amin Ahmed , J.- A household in an affluent neighborhood within the remit of Police Station Defence -A, Lahore was surprised at 2.30 p.m. on 6.7.2009 when three unknown intruders trespassed on gun point s; they were alongside the servants , namely , Ikram and Farooq, leading them apparently under coercion ; they kept the inmates as hostage and looted a number of articles comprising gold ornaments, valuable securities and cell phone handsets; the Criminal Appeals No.301 -L & 302 -L/2017 - 2- family was confined in a store and they left along with Ali Hussain Mehmood , aged  years.

[3] The culprits demanded ransom of Rs.3,00,00, 000/, subsequently settled as Rs.50,00,000/ -, paid on 26.8.2009 to secure release of the child. It is in this backdrop that a joint investigation team commenced the probe. The accused were arrayed through supplementary statements; one of the servants , namely , Ikram was identified as accomplice, a privy to the crime.

[4] As the investigation progressed, as many as eight persons were identified to have architected the episode with different roles, however, in collaboration with one another ; of them, Rab Nawaz and Munir were killed in a police encounter ; the appellants along with Mst. Nagina Bibi were arrested on 18.12.2009 .

[5] Muhammad Asif and Tayyab Shah were identified by the witnesses through a test identification parade . Pursuant to disclosure s, the accused led to various incriminat ing recoveries , including portion of cash received as ransom as well as jewelry. The child was recovered from the custody of Mst. Nagina Bib i, co-accused on 18.12.2009 .

[6] Indicted on 17.2.2010, the accused claimed trial, pursuant whereto , prosecution produced as many as twenty witnesses to drive home the charge ; they furnished ocular account of robbery as well as payment of ransom to Tayyab Shah and Muhammad Asif, appellants. Learned trial Judge convicted all the appellants ; they were senten ced to death barring Mst.

[7] Nagina Bibi , awarded imprisonment for life; their appeal s in the High Court failed albeit with alternation of death penalties into imprisonment for life vide impugned judgment dated 13.11.2014 vires whereof are being challenged through leave of the Court ; bound by a common thread, these are being decided through this single judgment. 2.

[8] Genesis of the occurrence cannot be doubted and the family certainly does not have an axe to grind against the accused ; two from amongst them have been done to death, statedly while resisting the police; Mst. Nagina Bibi has not opted to dispute her conviction and sentence, upheld by the High Court.

[9] Testimon ies furnished by the witnesses that include female members of the family have been found by us Criminal Appeals No.301 -L & 302 -L/2017 - 3- straight forward and confidence inspiring , duly corroborated by the recoveries that cannot be possibly foisted . Test identification parade and evidence of payment of ransom to Muhammad Asif and Tayyab Shah, appellants , squarely frame them with the crime by excluding every hypothesis of their innocence ; they have rightly been convicted and sentenced; the High Court has already shown leniency by converting penalties of death into im prisonment for life ; their appeal fail.

[10] Dismissed . Case of Muhammad Ikram Shah, Mehfooz Ahmed Shah and Ghafoor Ahmed Shah is on different footing. Muhammad Ikram Shah is identically placed with Farooq , the other servant in the family ; he was let off wit h a clean chit ; it is prosecution 's case that he alongside Ghafoor Ahmed Shah and Mehfooz Ahmed Shah shared information that took the investigating officer to the child , statedly , held by Mst.

[11] Nagina Bibi , co-accused ; assertion being non-specific , vague and joint , does not constitute disclosure within the contemplation of Article 40 of the Qanun -e-Shah adat Order, 1984 in absence whereof their culpability rests more upon a subjective belief rather than a positive proof; they are on crossroad ; their convictions cannot be maintained without potential risk of error , therefore , it would be conscionable to extend them benefit of doubt ; Criminal Appeal s to their extent are allowed .
