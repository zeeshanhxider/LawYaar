[1] order to understand the view point of the L.Rs of the deceased, the Court called them in Chambers and heard them individually . Mst. Ghazala , the mother of the deceased, told us in Chambers that she is a poor lady and after untimely death of her husband, she is earning the living of her family compris ing of two daughter s and a son , who was killed on a footpath/road in the evening of 1.4.2010 .

[2] She has further informed the Court that her brothers a re also from lower middle class family and hardly m ake their both ends meet and in this background, she and her daughters after the incident are scared and disturbed . Out of the two daughter s one namely Manahil stated that she c annot appear in the examinat ions because of the apprehensions regarding her safety.

[3] Mst. Ghazala further stated that State should take steps to ensure that those who have killed her son be punished. She, in so many words, has stated that she has not forgiven the accused persons nor h as entered into any compromise nor was terrorized by any one . According to her, it was the duty of the State to collect material against culprits and prove their 3 guilt.

[4] We have also called brothers of Mst. Ghazala and heard them besides the injured Muhamma d Hasnain, who perhaps was not giving true story. 3. We, in the given circumstances, are shocked to see the state of affairs where a mother of a young boy because of her weaknesses and other shortcomings is being compelled to give up her right to seek j ustice.

[5] The procedure provided under our p resent criminal justice system is very cumbersome. We can understand that the L.Rs of Zain deceased have lost confidence not only in the police but also in State machinery. They feel insecure and need to be assured that justice will be done. 4. Prima facie, t he manner in which the police has investigated the case is not transparent.

[6] We have failed to understand that why in a case of this nature the police ha d not produced the prosecution witnesses before the Magi strate for recording their statements under Section 164 Cr.P.C. We inquired from the police officials, present in Court, as to what prevented them from getting recorded the statements of the witnesses under Section 164 Cr.P.C, but no plausible explanation was offered from their side . 5.

[7] The Prosecutor General, Punjab, has informed us that the state has preferred an Appeal before the Lahore High Court against acquittal of the accused persons named in the F.I.R, taking all the available grounds. He submits that the propriety demands that these proceedings be deferred till the pending Appeal of the State is decided by the learned Lahore High Court, as any finding and /or observation made in these proceedings may cause prejudice to the case of either party. 6.

[8] We do not, in the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case, intend to comment on any aspect of investigation/prosecution at this point of time as it may influence the outcome of the pending Appeal filed by the State, therefore, we 4 adjourn this case sine die . Once the State Appeal is decided by the learned High Court, intimation shall be given by the Prosecutor General, Punjab, to this Court through the Registrar with a copy of the judgment immediately.

[9] Upon receipt of a copy of the judgment of the H igh Court, this Court may, if deem necessary, revive the present proceedings. We expect that the learned Lahore High Court shall decide the Appeal of the State expeditiously, preferably within two months from the date of communication of this Order. We may observe that if the L.Rs of the deceased or the injured victim seek protection of the police, then the I.G Police shall attend to the request. 7.

[10] A copy of this order be faxed to the Registrar of the Lahore High Court, Chief Secretary, I.G Police, Home Secretary, Prosecutor General, Advocate General, Punjab, and the L.Rs of the deceased Zain for their information and compliance. Office is further directed to immediately send back the R&P of the trial Court so that no delay is caused in hearing of the St ate Appeal. 8.

[11] Adjourned in terms of para 6 hereinabove. Judge Judge Judge Announced in open Court on ________________. Judge
