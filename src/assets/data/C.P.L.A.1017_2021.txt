[6] Mehmood A. Sh, AOR (In CP.1283 -) Ms. Abida Parveen Channar, ASC/AOR (In CP.442 -K/2021 & CMA.418 -K/21) For the NAB: Abdus Sattar Awan, Special Prosecutor, NAB. Mr. M . Hasan Akbar, Additional Prosecutor General , NAB (In all cases) Date of hearing: 14.04.2021 ORDER Qazi Muhammad Amin Ahmed, J. - The petitioners are arrayed as accu sed in different NAB references; they were admitted to bails, both anticipatory as well as post arrest by a learned Division Bench of High Court of Sindh at Sukkur in different Constitution Petitions , allowed on different dates in lieu of deposit of amounts allegedly embezzled by the each petitioner, vires whereof are being assailed.

[7] With unanimity it is argued that not only the stipulated condition is alien to law but also virtually tantamount to denial of relief that too foreclosing further avenues for the petitioner s. The learned Ad ditional Prosecutor General NAB has assailed the impu gned orders as well and with reasons more than one.

[8] According to the learned Law Officer , there existed irrefutable overwhelming evidence , documentary in nature, in each case that prima facie frame d the accused with the impugned transactions heavily incurr ing upon the exchequer ; he has further argued that in the absence of any element of mala fide there was no occasion for the learned Division Bench to extend judicial protection to the accused merely upon realization of e mbezzled amounts. 2.

[9] Heard. 3. Be that as it may, a wholesale treatment of motions seeking bail s, pre -arrest as well as post arrest, in an omnibus manner , in isolation to the distinct facts and circumstances of each case as well as different legal regimes applicable thereto , fails to com mend our approval . Exasperating delay in disposal of some 5 Civil Petition Nos. to ,  to ,  to ,  to , 442 -K/2021 and C.M.A.

[10] No.418 -K/2021 of the petitions has also been viewed by us with disquiet , as it appears to have obstructed the investigative process by unnecessarily placing the prosecution in a disadvantageous position ; it is eq ually discomforting to a claimant who justifiably seeks judicial protection. Petitions are converted into appeals and allowed; o rders impugned are set aside.

[11] Bail p etitions filed by the appellants before the High Court of Sindh are remitted and shall be de emed as pending for decision s afresh ; Accused on pre -arrest bail shall be notified by the Court for their appearance and remain on ad -interim bail upon furnishing bonds in the sum of Rs.500,000/ - with one surety each in the like amount to the satisfaction of Deputy Registrar (Judicial) of Sukkur Bench before the month is out .

[12] It is expected that the petitions shall be decided/disposed of with all convenient dispatch on their own merits having regard to the law declared by this Court in the case of Talat Ish aq Vs. National Accountability Bureau (PLD 2019 Supreme Court 12). Judge Judge Judge Islamabad 14th April, 2021 Not approved for reporting.
