[1] judgment dated 15.11.2018 of the Lahore High Court Rawalpindi Bench passed in Cr l. Appeal No. ) Shazia Bibi …Petitioner (s) Versus The State …Res pondent (s) For the Petitioner (s): Malik Jawwad Khalid , ASC For the State Mr. Muhammad Jaffar, Additional Prosecutor General, Punjab. Date of hearing: 08.1.20 20.

[2] JUDGMENT Qazi Muhammad Amin Ahmed, J. Shazia Bibi, petitioner herein, was apprehended with 4 -kilograms of cannabis during a random search on 28.12.2016 by a police contingent of Attock Khurd ; she was on board a public vehicle hailing from Peshawar; forensic report established narcotic character of the contraband ; upon conclusion of trial, convicted under Section 9(c) of the Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997 , she was sentenced to four y ears rigorous imprisonment with a direction to pay Rs.20,000/ - as fine or to undergo four months simple imprisonment in lieu thereof, vide judgment dated 23.2.2017 , upheld in appeal vide impugned judgment dated 15.11.2018 , vires whereof, are being assailed on the ground s that she has been targeted as a scapegoat by the police to settle score with her husband , a driver by profession, on loggerheads with the police over illegal demands.

[3] It is next argued that the case was liable to be thrown out for prosecution’s failure to come up with complete details/ protocol of forensic test s, carried out to establish the Jail Petition No. 847 of 201 8 2 nature of contraband allegedly recovered. Learned Law Officer faithfully defended the impugned judgment. 2.

[4] Heard. Record perused . 3. Quantity recovered, rather substantial in volume/ weight, cannot be possibly foisted upon a female to victimize her husband, himself a most suitable target, if at all the police had an axe to grind . All the prosecution witnesses including thos e of recovery have been found by us well within tune with one another ; soon after her arrest, with the assistance of a female staffer, she was produced before a Magistrate who remitted her into judicial custody , a most opportune occasion to raise protest ; her silence goes a long way to rebut the belatedly related story that otherwise may not find a buyer .

[5] Argument that the forensic report sans protocol is beside the mark as well inasmuch as tests carried out by the analyst are vividly mentioned therein, reproduced for the convenience of reference: - “Test Performed on Recei ved Item (s) of Evidence 1. Top load balance was used for weighing. 2. Chemical Spot Tests were used for Presumptive Testing. 3.

[6] Gas Chromatography -Mass Spectrometry was used for confirmation. Results and Conclusions Item # 01 3982 gram(s) of dark brown resinous material in sealed parcel contains Charas .” Above d etails mentioned in the forensic report substantially/ sufficiently qualify to meet the statutory requirements . Findings concurrently arrived by the Courts below, being well within the remit of law, do not call for interference.

[7] Petition fails. Leave declined. Judge Judge Islamabad 8th January , 2020 Not approved for reporting Azmat /-
