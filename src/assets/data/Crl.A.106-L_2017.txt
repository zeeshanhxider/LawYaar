[1] judgment dated 13.11.2014 passed by the Lahore High Court, Lahore in Crimina l Appeal No.2089 of 2010 and Murder Reference No.511 of 201 0). Manzoor Hussain alias Babo (In Crl.A.106 -L/2017) Muhammad Aslam (In Crl.P.981 -L/2017) …Appellant(s) …Petitioner(s) VERSUS The State (In both cases) …Respondent(s) For the Appellant(s) (In Crl.A.106 -L/2017) : Mr.

[2] Akhtar Hussain Bhatti , ASC For the Petitioner(s) (In Crl.P.981 -L/2017 ) : Mr. Salman Safdar , ASC For the State : Mr. Mazhar Sher Awan, Additional Prosecutor General , Punjab Date of Hearing : 17.05.2019 JUDGMENT Qazi Muhammad Amin Ahmed , J.- Muhammad Yar alias Bhatti, 20, was shot dead , in a marriage ceremony ‘Barat ’, on 10.4.2008 at 4.00 p.m. within remit of Police Stati on Cantt Okara .

[3] Manzoor Hussain, appellant was blamed for the crime . Bullet pierced the body 5 cm above right nipple , trapped in chest cavity, leaving behind blackened margin s. Motive for the crime is acrimony raging over divorce of deceased’s sister by th e appellant as well as litigation over agricultural land .

[4] The appellant stay ed away from law , finally arrested on 6.6.2008 ; pursuant to a disclosure , he led to the recovery of a .30 caliber pistol on 10.6.2008 . The appellant was indicted on 22.8.2008; Saifullah and his father Allah Ditta were arrayed as conspirators . The appellant Crl.A.106-L of 2017 & Crl.P.981 -L of 2017 . 2 blamed a stuck bullet going off accidentally during the aerial firing .

[5] Unimpressed by the plea, the learned trial Judge convicted the appellant under clause (b) of Pakistan Penal Code, 1860 and sentenced him to death with compensation vide judgment dated 30.8.2010 . Allah Ditta and his son Saifullah were however acquitted from the charge. A learned division bench of learned Lahore High Court maintained the conviction, however, alter ed penalty of death into imprisonment for life with benefit under Section 382 -B of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 .

[6] This brings both the appellant as well the complainant to us, former for acquittal while later for restoration of death penalty ; Crimin al Appeal 106 -L/2017 and Criminal Petition 981 -L/2017, bound by a common thread are being decided through this single judgment. 2. Event on the fateful day in the backdrop of b ad blood is a common ground .

[7] Ceremonial firing is unfortunately a usual phenom enon. It is prosecution case that taking advantage of the event, the appellant , actuated by a motive deliberately targeted the bullet, whereas the accused while pleading innocence has simultaneously advanced the theory of a stray fire shot, stuck in the ch amber, went off accidentally.

[8] Death by a .30 caliber bullet is not in dispute ; in this background , hypothesis of an accidental shot, as canvassed at the bar, is far from being impressive . Mechanics of .30 caliber pistol, a semi automatic weapon, rests upon a percussion cap with a primer, when detonate d by the hammer of firing pin ignites explosive propelling the bullet in high velocity to leave the muzzle ; in the process next bullet from the magazine automatically enters the chamber by the energy released by the preceding fire shot .

[9] A bullet would possibly stuck in the chamber if the hammer fails to ignite the explosive ; a defective primer makes the cartridge dead if all other components are in good condition . A second strike by the hammer is not possibl e without manual intervention and that too would seldom ignite the charge as the fixed length of firing pin would not go farther than the first strike.

[10] Therefore , it is difficult to contemplate a situation where deceased would naively stand within the approximate distance of four feet to receive bullet above Crl.A.106-L of 2017 & Crl.P.981 -L of 2017 . 3 the nipple , through an accidental shot . Bullet trajectory is yet another factor to contradict the story of accidental shot .

[11] If at all someone was attempting to retrieve the defective bu llet he had no occasion to hold the gun in a straight position ; from point of entry it traverse d through right pleura and lung landing on left side of the chest beneath 4/5th intercostal back , is a course that suggests assailant and the deceased standing face to face .

[12] Appellant’s plea , inherently flawed cannot dislodge preponderance of evidence furnished by the eye witnesses , found by us in a comfortable unison on all the details, salient as well as collateral therewith . Suggested scenario , otherwise too unrealistic to be received without being imprudent , merits outright rejection .

[13] Criminal Appeal 106 -L/2017 is dismissed. Imprisonment for life , a conscionable wage in circumstances also does not call for interference. As a natural corollary Criminal Petition No.981 - L/2017 is dismissed. JUDGE JUDGE Lahore , the 17th of May, 2019 Ghulam Raza /* JUDGE
