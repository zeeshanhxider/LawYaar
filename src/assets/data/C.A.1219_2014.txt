[1] judgment dated 19.9.2014 passed by the Election T ribunal -II, Quetta in Election Petition No. ) Khalid Hussain Magsi … Appellant VERSUS Mir Abdul Rahim Rind and others … Respondents For the Appellant : Kh. Saeed -uz-Zafar, ASC Mr. Muhammad Dawood Kasi, ASC For the Respondent (1): Syed Iftikhar Hussain Gillani, Sr.

[2] ASC Date of Hearing: 03.02.2016 JUDGMENT FAISAL ARAB, J .- In the General Elections that were held on 11.5.2013, the appellant and respondent No. 1 were the main contesting candidates from National Assembly seat NA -267 Kachi - cum-Jhal Magsi. For 1,47,595 registered voters of this constituency , the Election Commission setup 165 polling stations .

[3] In all 90728 votes were polled out of which 2448 were rejected for one reason or the other , leaving the tally of valid votes to 88280. The a ppellant bagged 42240 votes (48%) and the respondent No. 1 bagged 38915 votes (44%). Between them they both bagged 92% of the total valid votes that were cast in the constituency .

[4] Leading with a margin of 3325 votes the appellant was declared returned Civil Appeal No.  2 candidate. The respondent No. 1 was not satisfied with the result . He alleged rigging on the part of the appellant and filed an election petition before the Election Tribunal , Quetta . The challenge was mainly based on two ground s i.e. (i) at the behest of the appellant, the District Returning Officer and Returning Officer were changed without prior notice to any of the contesting candidates and (ii) polling agents of respondent No1 were detained for the entire duration of the polling time which facilitated the appellant to cast bogus vot es on 40 polling stations . 2.

[5] During pendency of the election petition, the respondent No. 1 filed an application before the Election Tribunal seeking verification of thumb impressions of the voters of 40 disputed polling stati ons through biometric system of NADRA . This application was granted. Record reflects that the counterfoils and the ballot papers of 39 polling stations were dispatched to NADRA for verification.

[6] NADRA then submitted its report. In the report, it was stated that out of 30,649 votes that were cast on 39 disputed polling stations , there were no CNIC numbers on 2143 counterfoils ; 40 votes were not even registered in the constituency ; 783 votes were found to be issued more than once ; counterfoils of 151 votes di d not have fingerprints on them and fingerprints on 4438 counterfoils could not be authenticated through biometric system.

[7] Hence, doubt was cast on 7555 votes by NADRA that were polled on 39 disputed polling stations . The Election Tribunal after recording evidence and hearing both the parties, allowed the election petition and ordered fresh election in the constituency. Civil Appeal No.  3 Aggrieved by this decision, the appellant has filed the present appeal. 3.

[8] Learned counsel for the appellant raised preliminary objectio n to the maintainability of respondent No.1’s election petition before the Election Tribunal on the ground that the same was not verified on oath before the oath commissioner as required under Section 63 of the Representation of the Peoples Act, 1976.

[9] He relied upon judgment s rendered in the case s of S.M.Ayub Vs. Yusuf Shah (PLD 1967 Supreme Court 486), Iqbal Zafar Jhagra Vs. Khalilur Rehman (2000 SCMR 250) and Ghazanfar Abbas Shah Vs. Mehr Khalid Mehmood Sargana (2015 SCMR 1585). Learned counsel for the ap pellant elaborated his argument on the preliminary objection by stating that election petition was signed on 2.7.2013 whereas the verification stamp of the oath commissioner is dated 3.7.2013, which clearly shows that the oath was not administered to the r espondent before the oath commissioner.

[10] On merits, l earned counsel for the appellant argued that the allegation against the appellant was that his two brothers detained the polling agents of the respondent No. 1 from going to their respective polling stati ons, which was practically not possible as two persons cannot prevent 40 polling agents from going to their respective polling stations of the constituency which was spread over about 200 kilometres .

[11] He also argued that the doubt cast by the NADRA on the v alidity of about 7555 votes does not mean that these votes were cast in favour of the appellant or that it was the appellant who indulged in any kind of rigging. Civil Appeal No.  4 4. In response to the maintainability of election petition, the le arned counsel for the res pondent No. 1 argued that many a times date is printed on the petition but the same is presented for verification on oath on any subsequent date, therefore, the difference of one day between the printed date and the date on which the petition was actually verified on oath do es not mean that no oath was administered to the respondent by the oath commissioner .

[12] He contended that the words ‘sworn before me ’ super imposed on the last page of the memo of election petition sufficient ly demonstrate that the petition was duly verified . He further contended that not only this but a separate affidavit of service was also sworn by the respondent on oath, which was appended to the election petition and this also clearly establishes that all the requirements of law with re gard to the verification of election petition were fulfilled. 5.

[13] With regard to the preliminary objection , all that we have to see is whether the memo of petition do reflect that the same was verified on oath and this is duly confirmed from the endorsem ent of the oath commissioner. The memo of petition clearly reflect s the date of verification in the handwriting of the oath commissioner and also contains his stamp ‘sworn before me ’.

[14] Hence, the election petition is to be taken as duly verified on oath. 6. As to the merits of the allegation, no doubt that nothing has come on record to establish that respondent No. 1’s polling agents were physically prevented from going to the polling Civil Appeal No.  5 stations. However, we have scrutinized the data of Form XVI which is a consolidated statement of the results of the vote-count of the entire constituency .

[15] From the consolidated statement it is apparent that on 54 polling stations, where one of the two contesting candidate had obtained no vote at all, the other contesting candidate had obtained almost all votes that were polled. It would be of considerable advantage to reproduce the data of the above referred 54 polling stations with the percentiles of votes that were cast in favour of each of the t wo main contesting candidat es and then analyze the same .

[18] From the above two tables containing vote count of 54 polling stations , it is surprising to note that on 21 polling stations where the appellant obtained not a single vote, the respondent No.1 bagged 98.4% of the total votes that were cast. Similarly, on the remaining 33 polling stations where respondent N o. 1 obtained not a single vote, the appellant bagged 99.8% of the total votes cast.

[19] It is also surprising to note that in the above discussed 54 polling stations , in all 50,922 votes were polled , the average of vote count comes to 943 votes per polling station whereas in the rest of 111 polling stations, where the remaining 37,35 8 votes were polled, this average stands at only 337 votes per polling station .

[20] The first question that come s to our mind is why on the above referred 54 polling stations where one contesting candidate ha d not even bagged a single vote , the percent age of polled vo tes in fovour of the other is phenomenal i.e. around 99%. The other question that arises is why on these 54 polling stations the turnout was almost triple in comparison to turnout on the rest of 111 polling stations i.e. the percentage of turnout on the ab ove mentioned 54 polling stations was 96% whereas turnout in the remaining 111 polling stations stood around 40% only.

[21] These unimaginable difference s in the voting pattern on 54 polling stations as against the remaining 111 polling stations cannot be a simple case of mere coincidence , given the fact that both the contesting candidates were not candidates with marginal following. They were politically popular figures of the constituency as 92% of the total votes that were polled went to both of them only .

[22] When the issue is analy sed from this perspective , the preponderance of Civil Appeal No.  8 probabilities leads us to believe that both the candidates must have exerted their respective political clout in their respective areas of influence in order to bag maximum number of vote s. 8. The analysis of above referred dat a, gathered from Form XVI , overshadows the submissions of the counsel of both the parties which they had advanced in favour of their respective clients as the polling data speak s louder than the words.

[23] This analys is of Form XVI coupled with the findings of NADRA in its report , where 7555 votes have been made doubtful as against returned candidate’s winning margin of only 3325 votes , confirms the prevalence of illegal practice at the election . We are, therefore, satisfied that the election to the National Assembly seat NA -267 Kachi -cum-Jhal Magsi was not conducted in fair manner and is liable to be declared as a whole void in terms of Section 70(b) of the Representation of the Peoples Act, 1976.

[24] This appeal fails and is hereby dismissed. JUDGE JUDGE JUDGE Islamabad , the Announced on ______________ Approved For Reporting Khurram
