[1] judgment dated 29.05.2014 passed by the Peshawar High Court, Mingora Bench (Dar -ul-Qaza) Sawat in Criminal Appeal No. 29-A of 201 2). Saleem Zada and others (in Cr.P. No.67 -P/2014) Muhammad Zada (in Cr.P. No.68 -P/2014) …Petitioner(s) VERSUS The State etc. (in Cr.P. No.67 -P/2014) Sher Zamin etc. (in Cr.P.

[2] No.68 -P/2014) …Respondent(s) For the Petitioner(s) (in both cases ) : Mr. Sahibzada Asadullah, ASC For the Respondent(s) : Mr. Zia Ur Rehman Khan, ASC (in both cases) Date of Hearing : 10.06.2019 JUDGMENT Qazi Muhammad Amin Ahmed , J.- Saleem Zada, Khawat Shah and Swat Shah, petitioners in Criminal Petition for Leave to Appeal No.67 -P/2014 alongside Sher Zam in, respondent in Criminal Petition for Leave to Appeal No.68 -P/2014 were tried for committing qatl-e-amd of Pir Zada as well as, attempt on Bahri Zaman alias Bahrey, PW; they were returned a guilty verdict by the trial Court vide judgment dated 7.2.2012.

[3] A learned Division Bench of the Peshawar High Court acquitted Sher Zam in from the charge, however, maintained conviction s and sentences consequent thereupon of the remainder vide impugned judgment dated 29.5.2014; this brings the complainant and the convict s before us; both issues with a common thread are being decided through this single judgment. 2.

[4] In the backdrop of previous enmity , on eventful day i.e. 26.11.2010 at 4.30 p.m., the petitioners and the respondent intercepted Pir Zada deceased and Bahri Zaman , PW while on board Criminal Petition Nos.67 & 68 -L of 201 4 2 a public vehicle; forcibly de-board ed, they were dealt with hatchet blows as well as fire shots , in consequence whereof , Pir Zada succumbed to the injuries at the crime scene while the complainant with multiple injuries survived th e assault.

[5] Incident was reported at the hospital and a formal case was registered 6.30 p.m. at Police Station Gagra, situated,  kilometers from the venue. The accused claimed trial, pursuant whereto, prosecution produced Bahri Zaman , PW-1 alongside Taj Habib Gul, PW -2 to bring home the charge; the latter is driver of the vehicle.

[6] Fate of the prosecution case is primarily hinged upon the statement of Bahri Zaman , PW-1. Taj Habib Gul, PW -2, driver of the vehicle though confirmed the episode, however , had not identified the assailants so as to establish their culpability. Investigative conclusions and medical evidence are in line with the statement of Bahri Zaman , PW-1; durations given in the crime report as well as by the doctor coincide with the time o f occurrence; the case was registered with a remarkable promptitude; previous bad blood has not seriously been contested; it is on the basis of these pieces of evidence that the accused have been found guilty of the crime.

[7] We have gone through the statement of Bahri Zaman , the sole eye witness and found him most confidence inspiring; he alone can sustain the charge; being injured, his presence cannot be doubted. Driver of the vehicle, though reticent in his deposition, nonetheless, has unambiguously confirmed circumstances whereunder the occurrence took place.

[8] Cross examination on both the witnesses remained inconsequential and as such convictions and sentences consequent thereupon do not call for interference. Acquittal of Sher Zam in, respondent , seemingly out of abundant caution, particularly having regard to his mute presence does not offend any principle of law ; there do not exist extra ordinary grounds to recall freedom .

[9] Resultantly, t hese petitions are dismissed and leave to appeal refused . JUDGE JUDGE Lahore, the 10th of June, 2019 Ghulam Raza/* JUDGE Criminal Petition Nos.67 & 68 -L of 201 4 3
