[2] Farhana Naz Marwat, ASC (in Jail Petition No. 474-P/2017 ) For the State: Mr. Zahid Yousaf Qureshi , Addl. A.G., KPK Date of hearing: 27.09.2019 . JUDGMENT Qazi Muhammad Amin Ahmed, J. Jail Petition No.474 of 2017 by Mst. Robina and Criminal Petition for Leave to Appeal No.83-P/2013 by her co -convict Izzat Ullah , bound by a common thread, are being decid ed through this single judgment; they were intercepted on 27.3.2010 at 10:00 a.m. within the precincts of Police Station Muhammad Riaz Shaheed District Kohat at a check - post while travelling in a vehicle bearing Registration No.

[3] AJD-911 Criminal Petition No. 83-P/2013 & Jail Petition No. 2 Sindh. Izzat Ullah petitioner was on the wheel , Mst. Robina being next to him ; on a suspect response , when questioned , the vehicle was extensively searched and the police contingent succeeded to discover a secret cavity in the fuel tank wherefrom 20 packs each with 1050 grams heroin were recovered .

[4] Soon after the arrest , Mst. Robina was produced before Mr. T illa Muhammad, Judicial Magistrate (PW -1) who recorded her confessional statement (Ex.PW -). Izzat Ullah petitioner opted to make his breast clean on the following day through statement (Ex.PW -). As the investigation pr ogressed, co-accused Majnoon son of Rustam was also taken on board for having dispatched the consignment.

[5] One Fida, an alleged privy to the transaction , is still away from the law. Upon indictment, the accused claimed trial whereupon prosecution produced a s many as eight witnesses , besides the forensic report to drive h ome the charge; they confronted prosecution evidence with unanimous denials with a reticence as to why they were roped in the case.

[6] The learned trial Judge extended benefit of the doubt to Majnoon co -accused, however, vide judgment dated 9.10.2012 proceeded to convict Izzat Ullah and Robina Bibi under section 9(c) of the Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997 ; the former was sentence d to death while l atter to imprisonment for life; their convictions were maintained by the High Court , however, death penalty awarded to Izzat Ullah was altered into imprisonment for life and it is so done on the request of his counsel on account of his be ing merely a carrier without deriving much benefit from the crime . 2.

[7] Validity of confessional statements as well as prosecution’s failure to establish safe custody and transmission are the main planks stressed on behalf of the convicts besides non - availability of public witnesses to attest the recovery. 3. Confessional statements before T illa Muhammad , Judicial Magistrate (PW-1), though retracted subsequently present formidable piece of evidence, inexorably pointed upon the convicts’ culpability.

[8] Mst. Robina made disclosure within a small span of time soon after her arrest, during her first appearance before the Magistrate ; Izzat Ullah followed the suit; both of them after having Criminal Petition No. 83-P/2013 & Jail Petition No. 3 been administered warning s and cautions, t hough disapprovingly on a printed format , nonetheless, made statements otherwise found by us as voluntary , natural and truthful with relevant details compatible with the salient features of the case ; brief interregnum rules out hypothesis of manipulation.

[9] Other pieces of evidence have been found by us as independently sufficient to drive home the charge ; forensic report confirms the lethal nature of the substance , recovered in a quantity that cannot be possibly foisted in routine ; seizure of the vehicle cli nches the case . Argument of safe custody does not hold much water as Abdul Faraz 28/C (PW -10) took the sample to the Forensic Science Laboratory along with Rahdari Ex.PW8/3 was not cross -examined despite opportunity.

[10] Forensic Report ( Ex.PZ) corroborates th e position taken by the said PW. Absence of public witnesses is beside the mark ; public recusal is an unfortunate norm. Prosecution witnesses are in a comfortable unison ; being functionaries of the Republic, they are second to none in status and their evidence can be relied upon unreservedly, if found trust worthy, as in the case in hand .

[11] Both the courts below have undertaken an exhaustive analysis of the prosecution case and concurred in their conclusion s regarding petitioners’ guilt and we have not been able to take a different view than concurrently taken by them . Petitions fail. Dismissed. Judge Judge Judge Islamabad 27th September, 2019 Not approved for reporting Azmat /-
