[6] Raja Jawad Ali Saahar, ASC for Manzoor Ahmed, Ali Muhammad, Niaz Hussain Illahi Bux, Taj Muhammad , Dawan and Ahmed (in Cr. P. No.92 -K/2021 ) does not contest convictio ns and instead prays for Criminal Petition Nos.92 -K and 100 -K of 2021 3 reduction of sentence to the period already undergone by them, in view of the riders provided under subsection 2 of section 337 N of the Pakistan Penal Code, 1860 l; he pledges payment of compensation to the injured as directed by t he learned trial Court.

[7] Learned Law Officer is not averse to the prayer made at the bar , as according to him, the case of aforesaid convicts, being first offenders, is covered by subsection 2 of section ibid. Criminal Petition No.92 -K of 2021 is dismissed as not pressed, however, sentences awarded to the petitioners therein are reduced to the period already undergone by them; upon payment of compensation , they shall be released forthwith, if not required to be detained in any other case. 2.

[8] Learned counsel for Muhammad Akbar petitioner contends that in the absence of a D.N.A. analysis, the petitioner cannot be saddled with the responsibility of carnal assault merely on solitary statement of the prosecutrix; adds that the prosecutrix was not recovered from p etitioner’s custody , a circumstance that escaped notice of the learned courts below ; complainant cast a wider net and it would be unsafe to maintain the conviction with a lifetime incarceration , concluded the learned counsel .

[9] The learned Law Officer conten ds that an hapless minor girl callously dragged out from the safety of her home was jointly molested, a beastly act, medically confirmed with a fetus in the uterus , the petitioner , being one of the offenders , has already leniently been visited with the alt ernate penalty of imprisonment for life ; he has taken us to the statement of the prosecutrix to argue that petitioner’s guilt is proved to the hilt . 3.

[10] Heard. Record perused. 4. Five members of the family with stamp of injuries unanimously blame d the pe titioner and co -convicts for having intruded into the dwelling to abduct the prosecutrix ; she was recovered by the police after almost four months from the house of Baqir co -accused, still away from law; medical evidence confirmed carnal assault with a fetus in its aftermath, leaving no space to entertain any hypothesis other than sexual assault; witnesses in a comfortable unison faced directionless cross -examination , mostly comprising of suggestions vehemently denied, without embarrassment ; most inspiring is statement of the prosecutrix , having endured the trauma , she related graphic details of abduction and subsequent treatment meted out during her captivity .

[11] In a rural neighbourhood, it is hard to believe that Criminal Petition Nos.92 -K and 100 -K of 2021 4 a family would join hands to level a false accusation at the cost of a perennial stigma , that too, without any motive or reason . Even investigative conclusions do not admit the hypothesis of a false case nor the l earned counsel his persistent denial , notwithstanding , has not been able to point out a ny flaw or infirmity in the statement s of the witnesses.

[12] In particular, statement of the prosecutrix does not admit a slightest doubt and as such by itself constitutes formidable evidence to independently drive home the charge with the support of irrefutab le clinical evidence , preponderance whereof does not require a confirmatory D.N.A. profile generation , a facility otherwise scarcely available way back in the year 2012; appraisal of evidence by the courts below , being in accord with the principles of safe administration call s for no interference .
