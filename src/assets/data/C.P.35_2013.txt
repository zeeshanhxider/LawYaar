Perusal of the report suggests that regarding alleged corruption in EOBI in the 106th BoT meeting held on 11.6.2013 one of the actions is reproduced herein below: “4.

[20] Muhammad Tariq Ka mal, former Director Town Planning DHA, Islamabad alleged that he is being threatened, therefore, the Secretary Interior, IGPs of Islamabad and Punjab are directed to provide him protection. 8. We had issued notice for the attendance of Mr. Zafar Iqbal Gondal, former Chairman, EOBI but he has not appeared.

[21] At this stage DG FIA has appeared and filed a repor t (CMA No.) , contents Const.P.No.35 of 2013 - 7 - of Paras No. 1 , 2, 7, 13, 14 & 18 of the same are reproduced hereinbelow: “1. Enquiry No. of F.I.A. C.B.C., Karachi was registered on 30.05.2013 after verification of a pseudonymous complaint received in FIA CBC, Karac hi alleging massive corrupt ion in EOBI, especially in property investment. 2.

[22] After completion of the enquiry, Case FIR No. of FIA CBC, Karachi dated 24.06.2013 has been registered u/s 409, 419, 468, 471, 109 of PPC r/w Section 5(2) of Prevention of Corruption Act 1947 against the Management of employees Old -Age Benefits Institution (EOBI), private property owners and others regarding purchase of four acres highly disputed land bearing Naclas 153, Survey No.536 & 537 of Deh Mehran, Tapo Malir, Karach i by EOBI at a very exorbitant rate excessively disproportionate to the then existing market rates.

[23] The land was not even in possession of the seller, and there were/are a number of claimants of the said piece of land. Besides, the land had no access/app roach. The property was purchased by EOBI for Pak Rupees 2.023 billions out of which reportedly approximately 50% (1.00billion) were received back as kickback under a pre -settled/agreed arrangement.

[24] Thus EOBI/government sustained a approximate loss of 2. 25 billions (including stamp duties/fees etc.) as a result of this shady, collusive, maneuvered and manipulated deal. 7. According to Mr. Muhammad Qasim Pervez, authorized representative of Mst. Nighat Asad Mirza and Maham Mirza, the above advertisement wa s just a formality and it was already agreed that EOBI would purchase only the land in question.

[25] Therefore, instead of submitted bid/application through given P.O. box No.30 Karachi, the bid/application of Rs. 165,000/ - (Rupees One lac and sixty five thou sand only_ per square yard for sale of 04 acres lands was submitted at the reception of EOBI. Subsequently, on the instructions of Mr. Wahid Khursheed Kunwar, DG Investment EOBI, a visit of the land by a team of valuators M/s.

[26] AAA/Colliers Pakistan Intern ational (Pvt) Ltd. was arranged. 13. Thus it is an established fact that an amount of Rs.809.248 million was paid at a time when the title of the land in question was not clear. A total sum of Rs.2.023 billion were disbursed to the sellers from the govern ment Exchequer which ultimately reached the accounts of the lady sellers.

[27] The sellers subsequently returned 50% of sale proceeds approx Rs.1 billion as kickback to the accused Zafar Const.P.No.35 of 2013 - 8 - Iqbal Gondal and Wahid Kursheed Kunwar being pre -settled deal through dif ferent means mainly through one Shaikh Farrukh Saleem, a clearing agent and close friend of accused Wahid Khursheed Kunwar. 14.

[28] Shaikh Farrukh Saleem during investigation voluntarily disclosed that he received an amount of Rs.710 Million from the sellers through cash cheques and cross cheques. He further disclosed that he deposited an amount of Rs.650 Million in his account maintained at Standard Chartered Bank Clifton Branch, Karachi and subsequently handed over the entire amount in cash to Wahid Khurshid Kanwar and Zafar Iqbal Gondal directly or through their nominated persons. 16.

[29] From the facts narrated above, it is established that accused (1) Zafar Iqbal gondal as chairman (2) Wahid Khursheed Kunwar as DG 9Investment) EOBI and as such public servants, were entrusted with EOBI funds, both while discharging their official duties, in complicity with (3) Muhammad Iqbal Dawood (employers’ Representative Sindh) (4) Malik Imtiaz Mehmood (Employees’ Representative Balochistan) and lady accused (5) Mst.

[30] Nighat Mirza w.o Col. (R) Ali Asad Mirza (6) Mst. Maham Najeeb d/o Col. (R)Ali Asad Mirza (7) Muhammad Qasim Pervaiz (representative of both the ladies) (8) col. (R) ali Asad Mirza and others have committed criminal breach of trust in respect of such funds and th us caused wrongful loss to the Government exchequer to the tune of approximately Rs. 2.25 billion and corresponding wrongful gain for themselves and other associates.” Likewise , in respect of some of the other transactions reference has been made in the r eport of Secretary .

[31] Be that as it may, we enquired from the Secre tary HR & Overseas as to why immediate steps were not taken to save the wealth of public exchequer after havin g taken over the charge, he stat ed that a case has already been registered refer ence of which has been given hereinabove, and according to the DG FIA three persons, namely, M/s.

[32] Wahid Khursheed Kunwar, (DG Investment), Mst. Maham Najeeb and Ali Asad Mirza have been arrested; whereas Mr. Qasim Pervaiz has obtained transitory bail on Const.P.No.35 of 2013 - 10 - beneficiaries of EOBI are entitled for the protection of their Fundamental Rights . 3) Secretary Interior shall strengthen the DG FIA by all owing him the services of the officer s/official s from within or outside the cadre of FIA, in accordance with rules because we feel that allegations which have been unearthed called for, serious efforts to collect evidence immediately instead of allowing to spoil the same. 9.
