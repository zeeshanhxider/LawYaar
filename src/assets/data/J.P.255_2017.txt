[4] Mr. Muhammad Sharif Janjua, ASC, at State expense, contends that there is inordinate delay between the occurrence and postmortem examination , suggesting the incident being an un -witnessed affair, details whereof, were discovered and deliberated subsequently ; while highlighting the role assigned to the acquitted co -accused, he argued that though somewhat inconsequential, nonetheless, was indivi sible inasmuch as two of them had allegedly clutched the deceased before he Jail Petition No.255 of 2017 2 was repeatedly shot on the opposite sides of his body and, thus, prosecution ’s failure qua the co -accused goes a long way to tremor the entire structure ; he has further referred to massive improvements in graduation of number of accused as well as manner of occurrence to argue that it would be unsafe to maintain the conviction particularly in the backdrop of ongoing blood feuds inter se the parties.
