[2] Iqbal Hashmi, ASC (in all cases) For the respondent : Mian Yousaf Umer, ASC a/w Mr. Imtiaz A. Shaukhat, AOR (in all cases) Date of hearing: 05.03.2020 JUDGMENT Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, J: - The question before us is to determ ine the date when tax refund becomes due to the petitioner ( taxpayer ) under the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 (the “Ordinance ”) for the purposes of Additi onal Payment or compensation for delayed refund . 2.

[3] Brief facts are that the petitioner filed tax ret urns alongwith refund application s for Tax Y ears 2004 to 2008. The refund application s were taken up under section 170 and rejected by the Assistant Commissioner Inland Revenue, Regional Tax Office, Lahore on 23.09.2010. O n appeal filed by the petitioner before the Commissioner Inland Revenue (Appeals ) [CIR (Appeals)] , Lahore the case was remanded to Taxation Officer on 15.02.2011 for a fresh decision .

[4] The Deputy Commissioner Inland Revenue (DCIT) decided the matter on 22.03.2013 granting refund to the petitioner , as well as , additional payment (compensation) for C.P.283 -L-2018 etc (1) 2 delayed refund w.e.f 15.02.2011 i.e., t he date when CIR (Appeals) decided the appeals and remanded the matters to the DCIT.

[5] Petitioner , aggrieved of the date of the refund due, preferred appeal s before CIR (Appeals) which were dismissed on the question of jurisdiction ; holding that no appe al lay against an order under section 171 of the Ordinance. The petitioner filed an appeal before the Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue (ATIR) which was a llowed vide order dated 12.09.20 14, granting Additional Payment (compensation ) to the petitioner for delayed refunds from the date of the deemed assessment under section 120 of the Ordinance when the petitioner had filed the annual income tax returns for the releva nt tax years.

[6] The tax department assailed the order before the High Court by filing appeals which were allowed vide impugned order dated 21.11.2017 holding the date of the refund due in terms of section 171(2)(a) to be w.e.f 22.03.2013 - the date when DCIT passed the refund order in favour of the petitioner. 3. We have heard the learned counsel for the parties .

[7] The petitioner defended the order of the Tribunal while the respondent department supported the view of the High Court in the impugned judgment. We have examined the relev ant provisions of the Ordinance, in particular, sections 120, 170, 171 and the Explanation inserted in section 171(2) vide Finance Act, 2013 , dated 01.07.2013.

[8] These provisions have been repr oduced in the Schedule to this j udgment for ready reference. 4. Under the scheme of the Ordinance (Chapter X, Part VI) a taxpayer , who has paid tax in excess of the amount which is properly chargeable under the Ordinance, may apply to the Commissioner for the refund of the excess under sect ion 170.

[9] The application for refund has to be in the prescribed form and verified in the prescribed manner and is to be made within three years of the later of the (i) assessment order (under section 120) issued by the Commissioner to the taxpayer for the tax year to which the refund application relates or (ii) the date on which the tax was paid.

[10] The Commissioner if satisfied that the tax has been overpaid by the tax payer may do the following in a sequential manner: (i) apply the excess in reduction of any tax due from the taxpayer C.P.283 -L-2018 etc (1) 3 under the Ordinance. ( ii) apply the balance, if any, to pay any outstanding liability of the taxpayer to pay other taxes and (iii) refund the remainder, if any to the ta xpayer.

[11] The Commissioner is to decide the refund application within 60 days of the receipt of the application and decide the same after granting a hearing to the taxpayer. Any one aggrieved of the refund order or the failure of the Commissioner to decide the application within the specified time can file an appeal as provided in the Ordinance.

[12] Once the refund order has been passed which may entail cash refund or adjustment against pending liability as envisaged under section 170(3). Thereafter, if the refund is delayed and not paid to the taxpayer within three month s of the date on which it becomes due, the taxpayer gets entitled to compensation at the rate of KIBOR plus 0.5 percent per annum of the amount of refund computed for the period commencing at the end of the three month period and ending on the date on whic h it is paid.

[13] Sub -section 2 of section 171 refers to dates which are treated to be the dates when the refund becomes due. Section s 170 and 171 , therefore, provide a complete mechanism for claiming tax refund by a tax payer. Such an application undergoes pro per scrutiny and only upon satisfaction of the Commissioner is the refund order issued. 5.

[14] The impression that deemed assessment under section 120, when the annual tax return filed under section 114 shows a refund payable to the taxpayer , passes for a r efund order, stands dispelled by the Explanation to section 171 inserted through Finance Act, 2013 , which states as under: Explanation .-- For the removal of doubt, it is clarified that where a refund order is made on an application under sub - section (1) o f section 170, for the purpose of compensation, the refund becomes due from the date refund order is made and not from the date the assessment of income treated to have been made by the Commissioner under section 120.” For removal of any doubt and a s a clarification , the Explanation provides that for the purposes of compensation , tax refund becomes due from the date of the refund order and not from the date of deemed assessment under section 120.

[15] In other words, the mechanism of refund under the Ordinance, works on the basis of a C.P.283 -L-2018 etc (1) 4 refund order passed on an application for refund filed by tax payer and duly s crutinized by the Commissioner and is not payable simply on the basis of the deem ed assessment under section 120 .

[16] The scheme of refund provided under the statute overrides the deeming provision of section 120. Deemed assessment under section 120 is , therefore, not a substitute for a refund order. It appears, as if the return of tax or refund by the E xchequer to a taxpayer requires scrutiny by the Commissio ner and cannot be deemed to be an amount outstanding in favour of the taxpayer.

[17] The taxpayer is free to apply for refund under section 170, immediately after the filing of the tax return or the deemed assessment. Section 170 prov ides a fast tracked mechani sm for refund as it specifies time for the passing of a refund order and the remedy of appeal in case of failure to pass any such order.

[18] Other than this fast -track refund mechanism there is no scheme of automatic refund on the basis of the deemed assessmen t as is made amply clear by the Explanation . The Explanation enjoys retrospective effect because it s purpose is “removal of doubt” besides supplying necessary statutory “clarification .” However, the retrospective operation of the Explanation shall not affect past and closed transactions where the benefit of refund and compensation has already been extended to the taxpayer on the basis of deemed assessment under section 120. 6.

[19] The instant case pertains to pre -2013 , it has been argued by the petitioner tha t the tax refund became due from the date of the deemed assessment under section 120 of the Ordinance. This argument is not avai lable to the petitioner. Firstly , the case of the petitioner is not a past and closed transaction and second ly, the petitioner had moved a refund application under section 170 of the Ordinance which was processed and finally refund order was passed on 22.03.2013 . 7.

[20] In the present case, the applications for refund filed by the petitioner under section 170 were taken up by Assistant Commissioner Inland Revenue in the year 2010 and initially rejected . After remand of the ma tter by CIR (Appeals), DCIT passed refund order on 22.03.2013. The matter remained under litigation C.P.283 -L-2018 etc (1) 5 between the department and the taxpayer , and refund order was passed on 2 3.03.2013 , rather than 15.02.2011, when the C IR (Appeals) simply remanded the matter to the DCIT to decide the same afresh.

[21] Therefore, the date of refund order passed by DCIT i.e., 22.03.2013 will be the date when the refund becomes due as per section 171(2)(c) [instead of section 171(2)(a) ] as correctly noted by the High Court . 8. For the above reasons, the se petition s fail and are , therefore, dismissed. Lahore , 05th March , 2020 .
