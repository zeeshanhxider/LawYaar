[1] judgment dated 02.11.2015 passed by the Lahore High Court Lahore in Crl. Appeal No. 243 of 2011 & M.R. No.133 of 2011 ) Arfan Akram …Petitioner (s) Versus The State …Res pondent (s) For the Petitioner (s): Nemo For the State : Mr. M. Usman, Deputy Prosecutor General Punjab Date of hearing: 03.03.2020.

[2] JUDGMENT Qazi Muhammad Amin Ahmed, J. - Irshad Bibi, 62, was shot dead at 11:00 a.m. on 26.1.2009, outside the threshold of her home , located within the precincts of Police Station Tandlianwala, District Faisalabad by Irfan Akram, petitioner, no other than her son -in-law; incident was reported 11:45 p.m. at the spot by her son Shakil Ahmed (PW -7).

[3] It was alleged that armed with a .30 caliber pistol , the petitioner persuaded the deceased to sell her residential enclave to apportion the proceed thereof with him; she decline d the suggestion at the cost of her life . Arrested on 27.10.2009 , the petitioner pursuant to a disclosure led to the recovery of a .30 caliber pistol , found wedded with the casing secured from the spot , dispatched for forensic analysis earlier to his arrest .

[4] A learned Additional Sessions Judge vide judgment dated 3.2.2 010 returned a guilty verdict ; he was sentenced to death under clause (b) of Section 302 of the Pakistan Penal Code, 1860 ; altered by the High Court into imprisonment for life vide impugn ed judgment dated 2.11.2015 , vires whereof are being Jail Petition No. 1 of 2016 2 assailed through a jail petition , filed with a delay of 23 days , condoned with a view to ensure safe administration of criminal justice . 2.

[5] We have examined the entire record with the assistance of the learned Law Officer to discover that the incident was reported with a remarkable promptitude . Occurrence took place at 11:00 a.m, reported to the police 45 minutes thereafter ; autopsy conducted at 5:00 p.m. cannot be viewed as delaye d; durations mentioned therein synchronize with the point of time reflected in the crime report.

[6] Shakil Ahmed (PW -7), deceased ’s real son and inmate of the same premises is a n atural witness by all standards; his evidence is duly corroborated by Munawar Hussain (PW-8). On all the salient features of the case as well as details collateral therewith, we have found them consistent, straightforward and confidence inspiring ; even otherwise, seemingly they do not have an axe to grind .

[7] On the contrary, petitione r being a brother -in-law could not be conceivably swapped as a scapegoat . Forensic reports are in the positive . Solitary fire shot is consistent with the weapon recovered and found wedded with the casing dispatched before arrest . Petitioner ’s absence from law for a considerable span of time heavily militates against the position taken by him during the trial ; his wife Raheela Bibi, a common link with the deceased , was the best person to vindicate his position; she is conspicuous by her absence from the scen e.

[8] Prosecution successfully drove home the charge to the hilt and we have not been able to find out any space to admit any hypothesis other than petitioner ’s guilt . Scales are in balance with wages conscionable in circumstances. Petition fails. Leave decli ned.
