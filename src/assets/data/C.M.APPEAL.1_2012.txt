[4] Appeal against the above order is competent before a learned Judge in Chambers in terms of Order V Rule 3 of the Supreme Court Rules, 1980. However, instead of disposing of the listed Civil Misc.Appeal in Chambe rs, it was ordered to be enlisted in Court under Order V Rule 5 of the Supreme Court Rules, 1980, which reads as under: - “5.

[5] The Registrar may, and if so directed by the Judge in Chambers, shall at any time, adjourn any matter and place it before the Judge in Chambers, and the Judge in Chambers may at any time refer any matter to the Court and the Court may direct that any matter shall be transferred from the Registrar or the Judge in Chambers to the Court.” 3.

[6] The learned Attorney General for Pakistan has stated that some of the objections have been removed. However, when we have inquired from him as to whether the question of maintainability or otherwise of the petition can be determined by the Registrar, he replied in affirmative. In this behalf, his attention has been drawn towards a judgment of this Court in the case of All Pakistan Newspapers Society v.

[7] Federation of Pakistan (PLD 2004 Supreme Court 600). On this, the learned Attorney General has submitted that subject to all, just and legal exception s, the Appeal under Order V Rule 3 of the Supreme Court Rules, 1980 may be entertained allowing the respondents to raise the question of maintainability at the relevant time.
