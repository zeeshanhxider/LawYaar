[1] judgment dated 24.04.2017 passed by the Peshawar High Court, Mingora Bench (Dar-ul-Qaza), Swat in Crl. Appeal No.199-M of 2014 ) Shah Nawaz Khan …Appellant (s) Versus The State …Res pondent (s) For the Appellant (s): Rana Abdul Latif Khan, ASC Mr. Mehmood A. Sheikh, AOR For the State: Mr. Anees M. Shahzad, State Counsel, KPK Date of hearing: 02.11.2020.

[2] JUDGMENT Qazi Muhammad Amin Ahmed, J. - Through leave of the Court, impugned herein is judgment dated 24.4.2017 by a learned Division Bench of the Peshawar High Court , Mingora Bench , whereby appellant’s conviction under section 9(c) of the Control of Narcotic Substances Act, 1997 , returned by a learned Addl.

[3] Sessions Judge Chitral vide judgment dated 23.7.2014 , has been upheld; he was tried alongside five others, since acquitted, for transportation of 12070 grams of cannabis in ten separate packs , concealed in a public vehicle No.3296/Peshawar registered in his name, intercepted by a contingent of Police Station Darosh District Chitral on 30.11.2012 while he was on the wheel .

[4] The appellant confronted indictment after retracting a detailed judicial confession recorded by a Judicial Magistrate (PW -3) whom he faced from the safety of judicial custody . 2. Heard. Record perused. 3. The learned trial Judge extended be nefit of the doubt to Nizam -ud-din, co -accused, employed as a conductor on the possibility of want of conscious knowledge whereas let off Shah Nawaz, Ashiq Jan, Criminal Appeal No. 231 of 2020 2 Abdul Nasir and Syed Hazrat, subsequently arrayed on the basis of appellant’s confession wherei n they were blamed as privy to the crime , a course that went unchallenged , otherwise unexceptionable.

[5] However, we have not been able to sway for the same path vis-à-vis the appellant. Even if, appellant’s confession purportedly recorded by his own choice when he was already remitted into judicial custody , is excluded from consideration, the prosecution still possessed overwhelming evidence to establish his exclusive culpability , beyond doubt ; he was not only on the driving seat but also owned the vehicle that carried huge cache of contraband , concealed in a secret cavity thereof ; seizure of cash of Rs.152,000/ - vide inventory adds to the credibility of operation carried out by the functionaries seemingly with no axe to grind .

[6] Testimony furnished by Abdul Hay at SHO (PW -1) and Sardar Wali Khan, SI/IO (PW -2) does not suffer from any flaw or infirmity ; both of them comf ortably faced cross -examination, otherwise hopelessly inconsequential and directionless. Surprisingly, presence of contraband in the vehicle is at tributed to an unknown passenger, vehemently denied by Abdul Hayat, SHO (PW -1), a position that goes a long way to help out the prosecution , otherwise well entrenched on the issue s of safe custody of the contraband and transmission of samples to the office of Chemical Examiner .

[7] Acquittal of co -accused, indicted on the basis of appellant’s confession as an unsuspecting carrier, does not bring him any benefit in retrospect . View taken by the Courts below being well within the remit of law does not call for in terference. Appeal fails. Dismissed.
