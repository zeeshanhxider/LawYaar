[1] judgment dated 13.06.2016 of the High Court of Sindh, Karachi passed in ITRA No., Constitutional Petition No.D - ) Commissioner Inland Revenue In C.P. 569-K/2016 FBR through Commissioner Inland Revenue In C.P. 570-K/2016 …Petitioner(s) VERSUS M/s ICI Pakistan In C.P. 569 -K/2016 M/s ICI Pakistan In C.P. 570 -K/2016 …Respondent(s) For the petitioner (s): Mr.

[2] Muhammad Sarfaraz Metlo, ASC For the respondent (s): Dr. Muhammad Farogh Naseem, ASC Mr. Mahmood A. Sheikh, AOR Date of hearing: 13.03.2017 … ORDER MIAN SAQIB NISAR, CJ. - The respondent company filed its tax returns for the year 2001 -02 and the assessment was finalized under Section 62 of the Income Tax Ordinance, 1979 (the Ordinance, 1979 ) by an order dated 29.05.2002.

[3] On 30.12.2004, the Department issued a notice under Section 122(5A) of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 (the Ordinance, 2001 ) to the respondent seeking to amend the assessment order dated 29.5.2002. The respondent replied to this subsequent notice on 8.3.2005. However the Departm ent took no further action upon the notice dated 30.12.2004 which was subsequently withdrawn .

[4] Finally, on 07.05.2007, a notice under Section 122(5 A) of the Ordinance, 2001 was issued by the Department stating therein that the date of de - merger was not properly appreciated by the assessing officer and CPs 569 -K,570 -K/16 -: 2 :- thus the assessment order passed on 29.05.2002 is erroneous and prejudicial to the interest of the Revenue.

[5] This notice was challenged by the respondent s through Writ Petition No. and during the penden cy thereof, an assessment order was passed pursuant to the notice dated 07.05.2007. This writ petition was allowed by the Division Bench of the learned High Court of Sindh on 30.05.2007 setting aside the notice dated 07.05.2007 and the assessment order pas sed pursuant thereto .

[6] Civil Appeal No.  initiated by the Department was dismissed by this Court vide order dated 29.10.2009 by relying upon the judgment reported as Commissioner of Income Tax Vs. Eli Lilly Pakistan (Pvt) Ltd. (2009 SCMR 1279) . Ther e was a lull for a considerable period when on 20.06.2011 the Department issued another notice to the respondents under Section 66 read with Section 66-A of the Ordinance, 1979 intending to amend the notice dated 29.5.2002.

[7] Aggrieved of th is notice, the re spondent filed C onstitutional Petition No. 11 before the learned High Court of Sindh which, by considering the law laid down in the judgments reported as Honda Shahrah -e-Faisal Association of Persons, Karachi Vs. Regional Commissioner of Income Tax, Karachi (2005 PTD 1316) , Eli Lilly ’s case (supra) and Commissioner I ncome Tax Vs.

[8] Islamic Investment Bank (2016 SCMR 816) , came to the conclusion that the period of limitation provided under Sections 66 and 66 -A of the Ordinance, 1979 is four years and tha t the notice issued by the petitioners on 20.06.2011 is beyond such period. 2. Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the said notice was in fact issued under Section 65 of the Ordinance, CPs 569 -K,570 -K/16 -: 3 :- 1979 and by relying upon Eli Lilly ’s case (supra) it is argued that the period of limitation has been provided in Section 65 of the Ordinance, 1979 which is five years and the notice issued on 07.05.2007 is within that period .

[9] Suffice it to say that after consider ing the notice dated 07.05.2007 purportedly issued under the provisions of Section 122(5A) of the Ordinance, 2001 , we find that it is akin to the notice/proceedings which the Department would initiate in terms of Section s 66 and 66-A of the Ordinance, 1979 as the said notice was issued on the ground tha t the assessment order dated 29.05.2002 was erroneous and prejudicial to the interest of the Revenue, the period of limitation for which is four years.

[10] We are not persuaded to hold that the notice was issued under Section 65 of the repealed law as the noti ce dated 07.05.2007 was not issued on the basis of some definite information . Even this is not envisaged by the clear language of the notice itself . Besides, as mentioned earlier this notice was set aside by the learned High Court of Sindh vide order dated 30.05.2007 which order kept intact by this Court.

[11] It is to be noted that after the judgment in Eli Lilly ’s case (supra) , a fresh notice was issued on 20.06.2011 which was challenged by way of a c onstitution petition before the learned High Court of Sindh and this was set aside vide impugned judgment as being issued far beyond the period of limitation.

[12] The judgment in Eli Lilly ’s case (supra) has neither provided a new cause of action to the petitioner to issue a notice afresh nor has it in any way extended the period of limitation originally prescribed for such a notice. We do not find there to be any error in such finding warranting any interference.

[13] Resultantly, CPs 569 -K,570 -K/16 -: 4 :- the view set out by the learned High Court i s absolutely in accordance with law. Dismissed acc ordingly. CHIEF JUSTICE JUDGE JUDGE ISLAMABAD. 13th March , 201 7. Approved for reporting Mudassar /
