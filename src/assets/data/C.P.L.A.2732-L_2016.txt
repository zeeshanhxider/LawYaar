[3] The High Court decline d to answer the reference in affirmative , vide impugned order dated 9.6.2016, on the ground that in the absence of “any definite information ” that too without confrontation to the assessee involving a factual controversy, the Department could not invoke the advisory jurisdiction . 2.

[4] Learned couns el for the petitioner contends that the learned High Court failed to consider facts of the case in their contextual backdrop that unambiguously constituted “ definite information ” within the contemplation of section 122(5) of the Ordinance, duly confirmed by documented transactions through banking channel , additionally verified by no other than the recipient i.e.

[5] M/s Shujabad Oil Mills Pvt. Ltd. The impugned order being slipshod calls for interference, concluded the learned counsel. Learned counsel for the r espondent has, however, defended the view taken by the Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue, by maintaining that refusal by the High Court to decline interference being well within the remit of law did not admit space for a probe into factual controversy . 3.

[6] Heard. Record perused. 4. Definite information within the contemplation of section 122(5) of the Ordinance contemplates an assessment in respect of a relevant tax year by the Commissioner , upon satisfaction of the conditions: i. any income charg eable to tax has escaped assessment; or ii. total income has been under -assessed, or assessed at too low a rate, or has been the subject of excessive relief or refund; or iii. any amount under a head of income has been misclassified.

[7] Position taken by the dep artment has a substance inasmuch as the respondent did not deny payments , the mode s thereof and product wise quantum of the purchases . Learned counsel for the respondent failed to substantiate his contention qua business activities with M/s Shujabaad Oil M ills Private Limited in the light of banking transactions.

[8] The Civil Petition No. 2732 -L of 2016 3 department has rightly determined the income of the respondent under section 39 of the Ordinance along with income tax chargeable and penalty consequent thereupon under section 182(2) thereof . The learned High Court failed to appreciate the law on the subject and passed the impugned order in a slipshod manner ; the same, therefore, cannot sustain ; the orders passed by the Commissioner Inland Revenue (Appeals) and the Deputy Commissioner Inland Re venue being well within the remit of law are restored .

[9] Petition is converted into appeal and same is allowed. Judge Judge Islamabad, the 7th January, 2021 Not approved for reporting Ghulam Raza /-
