[1] order dated 14.10.2021 passed by the Lahore High Court Lahore in Crl. Misc. No . 51549 -B/2021) Kashif alias Wajid alias Waju …..Petitioner (s) Versus The State & another …Res pondent (s) For the Petitioner (s): Mr. Aurangzeb Maral, ASC For the State : Ch.

[2] Irfan, SI and Nadeem, SHO For the Complainant: In person. Date of Hearing 27.01.2022. ORDER Qazi Muhammad Amin Ahmed, J. - Mohsin Ali Shah and Aftab son o f Ghulam Rasool were surprised by two unknown assassins at their Dera , 8:00 p.m. on 31.8.2015 , located within the precincts of Police Station Ferozwala District Gujranwala; incident was reported by Ghazanfar Ali Gillani, a nephew of Mohsin Ali Shah who ga ve assailants’ description , without citing motive for the crime .

[3] Mohsin Ali Shah deceased was survived by his daughters ; of them, Sidra Batool came forward to record a supplementary statement on 7.12.2015 wherein she nominated the petitioner and Muhammad Farooq as suspects for the crime ; she claimed to have herself witnessed the occurrence . Alleging complainant’s collaboration with Iqbal Butter co -accused, since acquitted, who according to her , had engaged the accused, hired assassins , to murder the decea sed in the backdrop of election rivalry .

[4] Criminal Petition No. 1225 of 2021 Pursuant to supplementary statement dated 7.12.2015, the police proceeded to arrest the petitioner and effected some recoveries on his disclosure; it also arrayed Iqbal Butter as architect behind the crime , howeve r, it is admitted at the bar that he has been acquitted from the charge .

[5] Blamed as hired assassin s, albeit with no past reflecting upon their alleged status , statedly employed with afore -named Iqbal Butter as his security guard s, the Investigating Officer recovered their uniforms in a bid to connect them with the crime . 2. Heard. Record perused. 3. Prosecution case initially set up in the crime report by Ghazanfar Ali Gillani, no other than deceased’s nephew , is diametrically different from the version advanced by Sidra Batool PW , a real daughter undoubtedly most devastated by the occurrence , nonetheless, her plea that she being a Parda Nashin lady unsuspectingly stayed away from the investigative process as well as evidentiary value of her supplementar y statement to take the petitioner on board in wake thereof are the issues that squarely bring petitioner’s case , for the present , within the purview of subsection 2 of section 497 of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 and, thus, would be best settled af ter recording of evidence during the trial , already in progress , in view whereof, it would be unconscionable to keep the petitioner in custody, particularly when it is not serving any useful purpose, relative to investigation.

[6] Petition is converted into ap peal and allowed; the appellant/petitioner shall be released on bail upon furnishing of a bond in the sum of Rs.500,000/ - with one surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of the trial Court. Judge Judge Judge Islamabad, the 27th January , 2022 Azma/-
