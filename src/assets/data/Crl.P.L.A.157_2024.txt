[8] The matter was adjourned for 9 August 2022 . After attending the hearing when he alongwith Munir Ahmed on one motorcycle and Gul Hassan and Rajab Laghari on another motorcycle reached near village Alhore Dhaio Malik , a green colour GLI car and one black colour motorcycle intercepted.

Accused Noor Muhammad made straight firing upon Rahib due to which he received firearm injury on the upper part of his left leg .

The injured Gul Hassan succumbed to the injuries on the spot while injured Rahib was lying unconscious due to firearm injuries. The injured and deceased were taken to Civil Hospital/DHQ Mirpur Mathelo .

[12] The injured was referred to Rahim Yar Khan for further treatment . 3. After hearing learned counsel for the petitioners, learned counsel for the complainant and learned Additional Prosecutor General, Sindh at length , we have perused the available record. It transpires that during Crl. P. No. 127 of 20 24 etc. 3 investigation both the petitioners had taken plea of alibi with the contention that on the date and time of the alleged occurrence , they both were visiting Agha Khan Hospital, Karachi and had also drawn cash from HBL, ATM booth installed within the Agha Khan Hospital at the date and time of the occurrence.

[13] Apart from recording statements of the witnesses durin g investigation, Call Data Record ( CDR) of petitioner Saeed Khan was also availed showing the presence of the petitioner Saeed Khan in Karachi at the date and time of the occurrence. The investigating officer also collected and verified the laboratory slips of the Agha Khan Hospital, Karachi showing presence of both the petitioners in Agha Khan Hospital, Karac hi on the date and time of the allege d occurrence.

[14] The investigating officer also collected CCTV footages of 16 July 2022 (18:34 hours ) of HBL, ATM booth Agha Khan Hospital, Karachi wherein both the petitioners were seen pr esent. 4. In view of all the above material, both the petitioners were placed in Column No. 2 of the Challan and in this regard report under section 173 Cr.P.C. was submitted by the investigating officer before the Court of Judicial Magistrate, Mirpur Mathelo who, vide order dated 3 Octobe r 2022 , endorsed the said report with the observation s that both the petitioners can be joined in the trial proceedings if sufficient/credible evidence comes on record against them 5.

[15] The above order dated 3 October 2022 passed by Judicial Magistrate , Mirpur Mathelo in favour of petitioners was challenged by the complainant in High Court of Sindh Bench at Sukkur by filing Criminal Miscellaneous Application No.S -535 of 2022 which was accepted vide order dated 24 July 20 23 and the matter was remanded to the Judicial Magistrate, Mirpur Mathelo with directions to pass a fresh and speaking order within fifteen days after providing opportunity of hearing to all the parties and considering all the available material/ the material placed before him. 6.

[16] After hearing all the concerned , vide order dated 12 August 2023 , while disagreeing with the opinion of the inves tigating officer, the Judicial Magistrate, Mirpur Mathelo took cognizance of the matter against all the nominated accused including the petitioners and forwarded the interim as well as final challan alongwith all the nominated accused including the petitioners for trial before Sessions C ourt, Ghotki .

[17] Crl. P. No. 127 of 20 24 etc. 4 We have been informed that t he trial proceedings have commenced and charge has been read over to all the nominated accused including the petitioners. 7. Apprehending their arrest by the police at the behest of the complainant for causing humiliation and unjustified harassment , the petitioners approached the trial court for grant of pre -arrest bail but the same was declined.

[18] The petitioners approached the High Court of Sindh Bench at Sukkur for pre -arrest bail but their applications have been dismissed vide separate orders dated 12 February 2024 . 8. The investigating off icer was summoned by this C ourt. On 26 July 2024 ASI Amanullah (investigating officer) appeared before this Court with the statement that he has investigated both the petitioners ; on completion of investigation both the petitioners were found innocent by the police due to lack of incriminating evidence and they both have bee n placed in Column No.2 of the Challan ; both the petitioners are no more required for any further investigation or probe as the trial has already commenced. 9.

[19] In view of all the a bove, the apprehension of the petitioners about their arrest by the police at the behest of the complainant with ulterior motives to create humiliation and unjustified harassment cannot be held vague or baseless. The investigati on has already been completed. No recovery of firearms has bee n affected from the petitioners.

[20] Admittedly, the petitioners facing trial are no more required for any further investigation or probe. The guilt or innocence of the petitioners is yet to be dete rmined at the trial after recording evidence. According to settled principles of law bail cannot be withheld as mere punishment. 10. On the basis of tentative assessment of the material so far available on record, the case against the petitioners falls within the ambit of further inquiry as well .

[21] In the cases of “Salman Mushtaq v The State”1, “Ahtisham Ali v The State ”2, “Fahad Hussain v The State ”3, “Gulshan Ali Solangi v. The State ”4, “Muhammad Sadiq v. The State ”5 and “Rana Muhammad Arshad v. Muhammad Rafique ”6 apart from the grounds of malafide, ulterior motive s and abuse of process of law , the accused were granted pre -arrest bail on the ground of further inquiry on the basis of tentative assessment of the material available on record. 1 2024 SCMR 14 2 2023 SCMR 975 3 2023 SCMR 364 4 2020 SCMR 249 5 2015 SCMR 1394 6 PLD 2009 SC 427 Crl.

[22] P. No. 127 of 20 24 etc. 5 11. The above are the reasons of our short order of even date whereby while granting leave to appeal, both the petition s were converted into appeal s. The same were accepted and the ad -interim pre-arrest bail granted to both the petitioners vide orders dated 5 July 2024 and 9 August 2024 have been confirmed.

[23] The observations made herein above are tentative in nature and same shall not influence merits of the case at the trial. Judge Judge Islamabad 23.08.2024 Atif*/ NOT APPROVED FOR REPORTING
