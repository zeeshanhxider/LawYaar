[1] order dated 20.04.2016 passed by the Peshawar High Court Pesha war passed in Cr. R. No.66-P/2015 with Cr. Misc. No.189 -P/2016 ) Muhammad Iltaf Khan …Petitioner (s) Versus Basheer and others …Res pondent (s) For the Petitioner (s): Mr. Muhammad Tariq Hoti , ASC Mr. Muhammad Ajmal Khan, AOR For the State : Mr.

[2] Shumayl Butt, Advocate General KP Malik Akhtar Hussain, Addl. Advocate General KP Mr. Aamir Javed, Addl. Attorney General for Pakistan. Date of hearing: 26.07.2021 ORDER Qazi Muhammad Amin Ahmed , J.- Aggrieved by certain imputations , viewed as calculatedly malignant , the petitioner instituted a criminal complaint under section 500 of the Pakistan Penal Code, 1860 (P.P.C. ), directly in the Court of Session at Mardan against his accusers , respondents herein ; they were summoned pursuant to the process of the Court to face indictment vide order dated 18.05.2015 , challenged on the ground that the learned Sessions Judge could not have issued the process without taking cognizance in derogation to the procedure provided under section 193 of th e Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (the Code ).

[3] The argument weighed with a learned Judge -in-Chamber of the Peshawar High Court and the process was quashed in pursuance thereto vide impugned judgment dated 20.04.2016 , being assailed herein . Respondents alongside the Attorney Criminal Petition No. 46-P/2016 2 General for Pakistan and Advocate General Khyber Pakhtunkhwa were sent for , latter to assist the Court . 2.

[4] According to the learned counsel for the petitioner , in the wake of addition of section 502 -A in the P.P.C. , introduced by Act IX of 2004 , there was no embargo left in the field for the Court of Session , standing in impediment to assumption of cognizance by itself for offences enumerated under Chapter XXI thereof as the said amendment expressly excluded the conventional magisteri al route ; he has laid emphasis on the non-obstante clause inserted in section 502 -A, to argue that it expressly left out application of the Code .

[5] Prominent amongst his various submissions and references was the argument that the legislature , in its wisdom and competence, devised a special procedure for expeditious disposal of cases of defamation within a stipulated timeframe and, thus, the Court of Session was consciously empowered to take direct cognizance in order to obviate procedural delays , a purpose t hat can be clearly ‘Read Down ’ without possibility of erro r; he was supported by the Advocate General Khyber Pakhtunkhwa who addressed on Court call.

[6] Learned counsel for the respondents, contrarily, defended the impugned judgment on the ground that non-obstante clause merely envisaged prosecution of the offence by a Court of Session, notwithstanding the quantum of sentence provided therefor and, thus, it could not be construed to have swept away the entire mechanism provided under the Code as embargo unde r section 193 of the Code expressly stood in impediment thereto ; he has referred to section 203-A, B and C of the Code to argue that expression “ taking of cognizance ” of designated offences, “in the court of competent jurisdiction ” is conspicuously missin g in section 502-A of the P .P.C. to unambiguously suggest that the complaint was to have been routed through the regular procedure; he has been supported by the Deputy Attorney General for Pakistan . 3.

[7] Heard. Record perused. 4. Section 193 of the Code places a complete and clear bar on taking of cognizance of any offence by the Court of Session in its original jurisdiction unless the case is sent up by a Magistrate under subsection 2 of section 190 of the Code. It is petitioner’s case that introduction o f section 502 -A inserted through the Defamation (Amendment Act IX ) of 2004 in the P.P.C. circumvents the supra bar Criminal Petition No. 46-P/2016 3 and a complaint for prosecution of defamation under section 500 of the P.P.C can be directly instituted in the Court of Session for decision within t he stipulated period of ninety days; the argument is built on the non-obstante clause that reads as under: “502-A.

[8] Trial of offences under this chapter. - Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 (Act V of 1898) , the Court of Session shall have the jurisdiction to try an offence under this Chapter and decide it within a period of ninety days .” A non-obstante clause in a Statute is a potent legislative tool often employed, essentially to achieve a limited/ specific statutory purpose , nonetheless, the concomitant overriding effect is purpose specific without impinging upon the structural integrity of the Statute; it merely presents a restricted deviation or departure without disturbing the overall functionality of the Statute .

[9] Offence under section 500 of the P.P.C. is punishable with imprisonment that may possibly extend to a period of 5 years and as such, triable by a Magistrate. The legislature in its wisdom desired an expeditious trial of the offence with right of appeal going to the High Court and this appears to be the dominant purpose for insertion of section 502A in the P.P.C. with no bearings upon the procedure , otherwise provided for the institution of a complaint ; aforesaid construction is supported by the l aw declared by this Court in the cases reported as Syed Azhar Hussain Shah and another Vs .
