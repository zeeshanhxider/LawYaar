[1] judgment dated 27.03.2018 o f the High Court of Sindh, Karachi passed in STRA No.737 of 2015) Commissioner Inland Revenue Zone-IV, Large Taxpayer Unit, Karachi … Appellant (s) Versus M/s Al -Abid Silk Mills Ltd. A -39, Manghopir Road, SITE, Karachi … Respondent (s) For the petitioner (s): Mrs. Asma Hamid, ASC For the respondent(s) : Mr.

[2] Ghulam Rasool Mangi, ASC/AOR (via video -link, Karachi) Date of hearing: 14.02.2023 JUDGMENT Athar Minallah , J.- The Commissioner Inland Revenue had sought leave against judgment , dated 27.03.2018 , of the High Court whereby question s of law proposed in a sales tax reference application , filed under section 47 of the Sales Tax Act 1990 ( ‘Act of 1990’ ), were answered and leave was g ranted by this Court vide order dated 20.07.2018. 2.

[3] The respondent , M/s Al -Abid Silk Mills Ltd. ( ‘taxpayer ’), is registered under the Act of 1990 and is engaged in the business of manufactur ing and export. Pursuant to a report of the Director ate General, Intelligence and Investigation ( ‘Directorate of I&I’ ), the Deputy Commissioner Inland Revenue served a show cause notice upon the tax payer , dated 31.01.2014.

[4] It was alleged that eight 2 CA  distinct entities , described in the show cause notice , were allegedly involved in the issuance of fake/flying invoices and they had not deposit ed the tax in the treasury. It was further alleged that the taxpayer had claimed input tax against invoices issued by the said eight distinct suppliers.

[5] It was , therefore, assumed that the invoices relating to supplies made by the eight enti ties were fake/flying. The taxpayer was, therefore, called upon , through the show cause notice , to explain why the input tax claimed against the alleged fake/flying invoices should not be recovered along with the default surcharge and additional tax.

[6] It is noted that the Directorate of I &I had not conducted an audit under section 25 of the Act of 19 90 nor was it vested with jurisdiction to do so. The Deputy Commissioner Inland Revenue had also mechanically proceeded on the basis of the report of the Directo r General, Directorate of I &I, because neither an audit was conducted under section 25 nor information was sought to have been obtained from the taxpayer under section 38 of the Act of 19 90.

[7] The show cause notice was adjudicated against the taxpayer vide Order-in-Original No. , dated 28.05.2014. The appeal preferred by the taxpayer was dismissed by the Commissioner Inland Revenue (Appeals) vide Order -in-Appeal dated 26.08.2014. The appeal preferred before the Appellate Tribunal Inland Revenue (‘Tribun al’) also did not succeed and it was dismissed vide judgment , dated 05.05.2015.

[8] The taxpayer invoked the jurisdiction of the High Court under section 47 of the Act of 1990 , by proposing question s of law stated to have arisen from the judgment of the Tribun al. The High Court an swered the proposed questions against the Department. 3. We have heard the learned counsels for the parties. 3 CA  4.

[9] It is an admitted position that the show cause notice was issued pursuant to the report received from the Directorate o f I&I. Before the issuance of the show cause notice no meaningful effort was made by t he sales tax officials to conduct an audit nor was a proper inquiry made by exercising powers conferred under the Act of 1990 in order to verify the allegations made in t he report.

[10] The show cause notice was based on vague allegations and an assumption that , since some of the supplies were made by the eight entities which were involved in the issuance of fake/flying invoices, therefore, the invoices relating to such supplie s must also have been of the same status. It was not the case of the Department that the eight entities were never engaged in business nor had made supplies.

[11] The taxpayer was asked by the sales tax authorities to provide documents which , at the relevant ti me, were not required to be maintained by a registered person under section 22 of the Act of 1990 e.g. gate passes, goods inward inventory record and transportation challans . These documents were inserted in section 22 of the Act of 1990 through the Financ e Act 2013 , dated 29.06.2013 , while the alleged transactions had taken place prior thereto.

[12] The Department, in a nutshell, had alleged that since the eight distinct suppliers were allegedly involved in issuance of fake/flying invoices, therefore, the presu mption was that the supplies relating to the invoices against which input was claimed had not been made. On this assumption it was alleged that the input claimed was inadmissible under section 8(1)(c)(a) of the Act of 1969 .

[13] The said provision contemplates that input cannot be claimed on goods or services in respect of which sales tax has not been deposited in the government treasury by the respective supplier. In essence, the onus was on the D epartment to first establish that the eight suppliers had not mad e actual supplies 4 CA  and, thus, the invoices against which the input was claimed were fake/flying invoices .

[14] Moreover, it was the Department ’s responsibility to verify whether or not the eight entities had deposited the sales tax in the government treasury relating to the invoices against which the taxpayer had claimed input tax. I t is evident from the record that the Department had made no attempt to verify whether the invoices relatable to the claim of input tax were fake/ flying or otherwise.

[15] The expression i nput tax and output tax have been defined under clauses 14 and 20 of section 2 of the Act of 1990 , respectively . The liability raised against the taxpayer , vide the Order -in-Original , was based on mere presumption s while the sale tax authorities had failed in their duty to establish the allegations before the adjudicating authorities .

[16] The appeals were dismissed by the Commissioner Inland Revenue (Appeals) and the Tribunal on the ground that though the record sought from the taxpayer was not required to be m aintained under section 22 of the Act of 1969 , yet it was the latter 's obligation to prove that supplies were actually made to it.

[17] After issuing a show cause notice without conducting an audit or making a proper inquiry a reverse onus was placed on the tax payer. 5. The Act of 1990 is a complete comprehensive statute dealing with the levy, charge and payment of sales tax on taxable supplies made by a registered person in the course o r furtherance of any taxable activity carried on by such registered pe rson.

[18] The levy, charge or payment of sales tax is attracted when there is taxable supply and such taxable supply must have been made in the course or furtherance of any taxable activity carried out by a registered person. The expression ‘taxable supply ', ‘value’ and ‘taxable activity’ have been defined in section 2 (41), (46) and 35 respectively.

[19] The 5 CA  expression ‘output tax’ has been defined in section 2(20) in relation to a registered person as, inter alia, mean ing tax levied under the Act of 1990 on the supply of goods made by the person. The liability to pay the output tax is, therefore, that of a supplier which in th is case were the eight distinct entities.

[20] Section 7 describes the mechanism for determination of the tax liability and provides that , subject to the provisions of section 8 , a registered person shall be entitled to deduct input tax paid or payable during the tax period for the purpose of taxable supplies made or to be made from the out put tax.

[21] The expression ‘input tax’ has been defined under section 2(14) in relation to a registered person as, inter alia, mean ing the tax levied under th e Act of 1990 on supply of goods to the person. As a corollary , a person who receives a supply of taxable goods is entitled and eligible to deduct tax paid on the supply of goods received by the latter.

[22] The input tax in th is case was adjusted by the taxpayer. 6. It is settled law that , while interpreting fiscal statutes, the court looks to what is clearly said and there is no room for any intendment nor is there any equity about a tax . There is no presumption as to tax and nothing was to be read in or implied and one could only look fairly at the language used.12345. 7.

[23] The scheme of the Act of 19 90 clearly envisages that the obligation to e stablish that a person was liable to pay any tax or charge and the same has not been levied or paid or has been short - levied is essential ly that of the sale s tax authorities. The burden to 1 M/s Mirpurkhas Sugar Mil ls Ltd. v.

( PLD 1990 SC 68 ) 6 CA  prove that the tax has not been paid is on the sales tax authorities.

[25] In order to dischar ge this obligation they have been vested with wide powers under the Act of 1990. It is well settled that whoever asserts a fact is also burdened with the duty to establish that it is highly probable to be true. In some exceptional cases, the legislature, i n its wisdom, has provided for what is known as reverse onus , by placing the burden on the person against whom an allegation has been made .

[26] Section 1 87 of the Customs Act, 1969 and section 14 of the National Accountability Ordinance, 1999 are such illustra tions . The concept of reverse onus i.e. placing the burden on the person against whom an allegation has been made runs contrary to the established principle of presumption of innocence.

[27] It is therefore, for this reason that Courts lean in favour of interpr eting or reading down such provision in an effort to safeguard the fundamental principles of fair trial. There is no provision pari materia with section 187 of the Customs Act 1969 or section 14 of the National Accountability Ordinance, 1999 , in the Act of 1990.

[28] The legislature , therefore, did not intend to reverse the onus of proof in matters relating to the levy, charge and payment of the tax under the Act of 1990 . The proceedings before the adjudicating authority or the statutory appellate forum under th e Act of 19 90 are quasi judicial in nature. When the department alleges that a registered person is liable to make the payment of tax and the same has not been levied or charged, the former is burdened with a statutory duty to establish before the adjudica ting forum , through persu asive and proper evidence , that the allegations are highly probable to be true, rather than being unreliable, false or doubtful.

[29] The duty to establish facts on the standard of balance of probabilities is on the department under the Act of 19 90. 7 CA  8. In the case in hand, the show cause notice was issued in a mechan ical manner. The allegations were vague and the facts had not been verified. Moreover, the taxpayer was asked to establish that its suppliers i.e. the eight distinct entitie s had not made supplies and that the y had not deposited the output tax in the government treasury.

[30] It was on this basis that it was presumed that the invoices were fake/flying and thus the input tax adjusted against such invoices was alleged to be inadmiss ible. The taxpayer was further asked to produce documents which w ere not required to be maintained under the Act of 19 90 at the relevant time.

[31] The department had issued a vague show cause notice pursuant to a report , without first making an inquiry of its own to verify the facts relating to the eight entities i.e whether they had deposited the tax in relation to the supply made to the taxpayer. The High Court has correctly interpreted the provisions of the Act of 19 90 in the context of the facts and circum stances of the case before us.

[32] The appreciation of the provisions of the Act of 19 90 by the High Court have been found to be unimpeachable. The Department has not been able to make out a case for grant of leave and, therefore, the petition is accordingly d ismissed. These are the reasons for our short order dated 14.02.2023.
