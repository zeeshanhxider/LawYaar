[4] Whereas, according to the learned counsel, the rights of the parties cannot be decided under Sections 372 and 278 of the Succession Act, 1925 which provides for a summary procedure, hence the remedy lies before the competent court of civil jurisdiction by filing a suit for determination of title etc.

[5] According to the learned counsel for the petitioner, since the matter relates to rights and entitlement in respect of movable and immovable property, being pai't of the estate left behind by deceased Moulvi Abdul Sattar, the brother of the petitioner. therefore, the learned Single Judge of the High Court could not decide the matter in a summary manner under Sections 372 and judgment is liable to be set aside.

Civil Petition No.259-Q of2020 4 the respondents want to produce additional evidence, they may respondents do not want to produce the evidence, the evidence already produced by them be considered accordingly. The trial court should then decide the matter on the basis of the evidence and the material available before it, strictly in accordance with law and on its own merits.

[12] Perusal of the impugned judgment passed by the 5. learned Single Judge of the High Court of Balochistan, Sibi Bench reflects that after having taken cognizance of all the material facts and ihe evidence produced by the respondents in documentary evidence, including school admission certificate No.4431 dated 16^1' September, 2009 of Government High Court, Jaffarabad through school representative who exhibited the sameor incase the also be provided an opportunity to do so, are directed to co-operate the trial court.

Zahida Parveen (both son and daughter of Moulvi Abdul Sattar).

[17] The record further reveals that besides the oral 6. evidence (fourteen witnesses) number of public documents as referred in the impugned judgment, being part of the official record, were produced and admitted in evidence without any objection by the petitioner, therefore, the presumption of correctness attached to the official record in terms of Article 91 and the relevancy of entry in public record made in performance of duty in terms of Article 49 of the Qanun-e-Shahadat Order, 1984 are fully attracted to the facts of the instant case.

[18] It is pertinent to mention that in view of the overwhelming oral as well establish their parentage, and in the absence of any material or evidence produced by the petitioner to dislodge such claim of the not justified to dismiss respondents were the adopted children of deceased Moulvi Abdul Sattar. Since the procedure under Section 372 and 278 of the Succession Act, 1925 is summary in nature, therefore, in case of any dispute relating to determination of right in any movable and immovable property, left behind by a deceased or the challenge to the paternity/legitimacy of the children could have been agitated by the party disputing such right before the competent court of civil jurisdiction while producing the evidence to this effect.

[19] It isrespondents, the learned trial court was the succession applications hied under Sections 372 and 278 onas documentary evidence produced by the respondents to mere allegation by the petitioner to the effect that the 7 Civil Petition No.259-Q of2020 regretted to observe that in the absence of any material or evidence to support the allegation of the petitioner relating to paternity/legitimacy of respondents namely, Yar Muhammad and and daughter of Moulvi Abdul Sattar), the Succession Certificate could not be issued since 2009, and the legal heirs have been deprived of their right of inheritance in respect of estate left behind their father namely, Moulvi Abdul Sattar on above false and frivolous grounds.

[20] Without prejudice to hereinabove factual and legal 7. position as emerged in the instant case, we deem it appropriate to take cognizance of the settled legal position relating to child in terms of judgments of this Court in the case of Laila Qayyum v. Fawad Qayum and others (PLD 2019 SC 449) and Munir Hussain v.

It has been further held that to challenge another ’s assertion of one ’s own legal character in terms of Section 42 of the Specific Relief Act, 1877. Whereas in the instant case the petitioner who claims to be brother of deceased Moulvi Abdul Sattar has no legal character to challenge the paternity/legitimacy of respondents in succession suit in terms of Section 42 of the Specific Relief Act, 1877, seeking a negative declaration to this effect.proceedings without even filing aMst.
