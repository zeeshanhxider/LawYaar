[63] Consequent upon recommendations of the Departmental Selection Committee, the Respondents were appointed on different posts in the Scheme “Establishment and Up -gradation of Veterinary Outlets (Phase - III)ADP ”, on contract basis for the entire duration of the Project , vide orders dated 4.4.2007, 13.4.2007. 17.4.20 07 and 19.6.2007 , respectively.

[64] The contract period was extended from time to time when on 05.06.2009, a CAs.134 -P/2013 etc 16 notice was served upon them, intimating them that their services were no longer required after 30.06.2009. The Respondents invoked the constitutional j urisdiction of the Peshawar High Court, by filing Writ Petition No.2001 of 2009, against the order dated 05.06.2009.

[65] The Writ Petition of the Respondents was disposed of, by judgment dated 17.05.2012, directing the Appellants to treat the Respondents as re gular employees from the date of their termination. Hence this Appeal by the Appellants. Civil Appeal No.113 -P of 2013 Establishment of One Science and One Computer Lab in Schools/Colleges of NWFP 14.

[66] On 26.09.2006 upon the recommendations of the Departm ental Selection Committee, the Respondents were appointed on different posts in the Scheme “Establishment of One Science and One Computer Lab in School/Colleges of NWFP”, on contract basis. Their terms of contractual appointments were extended from time to time when on 06.06.2009, they were served with a notice that their service s were not required any more .

[67] The Respondents filed Writ Petition No.2380 of 2009, which was allowed on the analogy of judgment rendered in Writ Petition No.2001 of 2009 passed on 1 7.05.2012. Hence this Appeal by the Appellants. Civil Appeals No.231 and 232 -P of 2015 National Program for improvement of Water Courses in Pakistan 15.

[68] Upon the recommendations of the Departmental Selection Committee, the Respondents in both the Appeal s were appointed on different posts in “National Program for I mprovement of Water Courses in Pakistan ”, on 17th January 2005 and 19th November 2005, respectively, initially on contract basis for a period of one year , which was extended CAs.134 -P/2013 etc 17 from time to time.

[69] The Appellants terminated the service of the Respondents w.e.f 01.07.2011, therefore, the Respondents approached the Peshawar High Court, mainly on the ground that the employees placed in similar posts had approached the High Court through W.Ps.No.,  and  , which Petitions were allowed by judgment dated 21.01.2009 and 04.03.2009.

[70] The Appellants filed Review Petitions before the Peshawar High Court, which were disposed of but still disqualified the Appellants f iled Civil Petitions No.85, 8 6, 87 and 91 of 2010 before this Court and Appeals No.834 to  arising out of said Petitions were eventually dismissed on 01.03.2011. The learned High Court allowed the Writ Petitions of the Respondents with the direction to treat the Respondents as regular employees.

[71] Hence these Appeals by the Appellants. Civil Petition No.496 -P of 2014. Provision of Population Welfare Programme 16. In the year 2012, consequent upon the recommendations of the Departmental Selection Committee, the Respondents were appointed on various posts in the project namely “Provision of Population Welfare Programme” on contract basis for the entire duration of the Project .

[72] On 08.01.2012, the Project was brought under the regular Provincial Budget . The Respondents applied for their regularization on the touchstone of the judgments already passed by the learned High Court and this Court on the subject. The Appellants contended that the posts of the Respondents did not fall under the scope of the intended regularization, therefor e, they preferred Writ Petition No.1730 of 2014, which was disposed of, in view of the judgment of the learned High Court dated 30.01.2014 passed in Writ CAs.134 -P/2013 etc 18 Petition No.2131 of 2013 and judgment of this Court in Civil Petition No.344 -P of 2012.

[73] Hence these Ap peals by the Appellants. Civil Petition No.34 -P of 2015 Pakistan Institute of Community Ophthalmology Hayatabad Medical Complex, Peshawar 17. The Respondents were appointed on various posts in the “Pakistan Institute of Community Ophthalmology Hayatabad Medical Complex ”, Peshawar , in the years 2001, 2002 and from 2007 to 2012, on contract basis.

[74] Through advertisement dated 10.01.2014, the said Medical Complex sought fresh Applications through advertisement against the posts held by them. Therefore, the R espondents filed Writ Petition No.141 of 2004 , which was disposed of more or less in the terms as state above. Hence this Petition. 18. Mr.

[75] Waqar Ahmed Khan, Addl. A dvocate General, KPK , appeared on behalf of Govt. of KPK and submitted that the employees in these Appeals/ P etitions were appointed on different dates since 1980. In order to regularize their services , 302 new posts were created . According to him, under the scheme the Project employees were to be appointed stage wise on these posts.

[76] Subsequent ly, a n umber of Project employees filed Writ Petitions and the learned High Court directed for issuance of orders for the regularization of the Project employees. He further submitted that the concessional statement made by the then Addl. Advocate General , KPK , before the learned High Court to “adjust/regularize the petitioners on the vacant post or posts whenever falling vacant in future but in order of seniority/eligibility.” was not in accordance with law.

[77] The employees were appointed on Projects and the ir appointments on these Projects were to be terminated on the expiry of the P roject as it was stipulated that they will not CAs.134 -P/2013 etc 19 claim any right of absorption in the D epartment against regular post s as per existing Project policy.

[78] He also referred to the offic e order dated 31.12.2004 regarding appointment of Mr. Adnanullah (Respondent in CA. No.134 -P/2013) and submitted that he was appointed on contract basis for a period of one year and the above mentioned office order clearly indicates that he was neither ent itled to pension nor GP Fund and furthermore, had no right of seniority and or regular appointment.

[79] His main contention was that the nature of appointment of these Project employees was evident from the advertisement, office order and the ir appointment let ters. All these reflected that they were not entitled to regularization as per the terms of their appointments. 19. In the month of November 2006, a proposal was floated for restructuring and establishment of Regular Offices of “On Farm Water Management Department ” at District level in NWFP (now KPK) which was approved by the then Chief Minister KPK; who agreed to create 302 posts of different categories and the expenditure involved was to be met out of the budgetary allocation.

[80] The em ployees already work ing in the P rojects were to be appointed on seniority basis on these newly created posts. Some of the employees working since 1980 had preferential rights for their regularization. In this regard, he also referred to various Notifications since 1980, where by the Governor KPK was pleased to appoint the candidates upon the recommendations of the KPK Public Service Commission on different Projects on temporary basis and they were to be governed by the KPK Civil Servants Act 1973 and the Rules framed thereunder . 302 posts were created in pursuance of the summary of 2006, out of which 254 posts CAs.134 -P/2013 etc 20 were filled on seniority basis, 10 through promotion and 38 by way of Court orders passed by this Court and or the learned Peshawar High Court.

[81] He referred to the case of Govt. of NWFP vs. Abdullah Khan (2011 SCMR 898) whereby , the contention of the Appellants (Govt. of NWFP) that the Respondents were Project employees appointed on contractual basis were not entitled to be regularized, was not accepted and it was observed by this Court that definition of “Contract appointment” contained in Section 2(1)(aa) of the NWFP Employees (Regularization of Services) Act, 2009, was not attracted in the cases of the Respondent employees.

[82] Thereafter, in the case of Government of NWFP vs . Kaleem Shah (2011 SCMR 1004), this Court followed the judgment of Govt. of NWFP vs. Abdullah Khan (ibid) . The judgment, however, was wrongly decided . He further contended that KPK Civil Servants (Amendment) Act 2005, (whereby Section 19 of the KP K Civil Servants Act 1973, was substituted ), was not applicable to Project employees.

[83] Section 5 of the KPK Civil Servants Act 1973, states that the appointment to a civil service of the Province or to a civil post in connection with the affairs of the Province sha ll be made in the prescribed manner by the Governor or by a person authorized by the Governor in that behalf. But in the cases in hand, the Project employees were appointed by the Project Director, therefore, they could not claim any right to regularizatio n under the aforesaid provision of law.

[84] Furthermore, he contended that the judgment passed by the learned Peshawar High Court is liable to be set aside as it is solely based on the facts that the Respondents who were originally appointed in 1980 had been r egularized. He submitted that the High Court erred in regularizing the employees on the touchstone of Article 25 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan as the CAs.134 -P/2013 etc 21 employees appointed in 2005 and those in 1980 were not similarly placed and, therefore, there was no question of discrimination .

[85] According to him, they will have to come through fresh inductions to relevant posts if they wish to fall under the scheme of regularization . He further contended that any wrongful action that may have taken place previously, could not justify the commission of another wrong on the basis of such plea.

[86] The cases where the orders were passed by DCO without lawful authority could not be said to have been made in accordance with law. Therefore, even if some of the employees had been regularized due to previous wrongful action, others could not take plea of being treated in the same manner . In this regard , he has relied upon the case of Government of Punjab vs.

[87] Zafar Iqbal Dogar (2011 SCMR 1239) and Abdul Wahid vs. Chairman CBR (1998 SCMR 882). 20. Mr. Ghulam Nabi Khan, learned ASC , appeared on behalf of Respondent(s) in C.As.134 -P/2013, 1 -P/2013 and C.P.28 -P/2014 and submitted that all of his clients were clerks and appointed on non - commissioned posts.

[88] He further submitted that the issue before this Court had already been decided by four different benches of this Court from time to time and one review petition in this regard had also been dismissed. He contended that fifteen Hon’ble Judges of this Court had alread y given their view in favour of the Respondents and the matter should not have been referred to this Bench for review .

[89] He further contended that no employee was regularized until and unless the Project on which he was working was not put under the regular Provincial B udget as such no regular posts were created. The process of reg ularization was started by the G overnment itself CAs.134 -P/2013 etc 22 without intervention of this Court and without any Act or Statute of the Government.

[90] Many of the decisions of the Peshawar High Cour t were available , wherein the directions for regularization were issued on the basis of discrimination. All the present cases before this Court are related to the category in which the Project became part of the regular Provincial B udget and the posts were created.

[91] Thousands of employees were appointed against these posts. He referred to the case of Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto Vs. The State (PLD 1979 SC 741) and submitted that a review was not justifiable , notwithstanding error being apparent on face of record, if judgment or finding, although suffering from an erroneous assumption of facts, was sustainable on other grounds available on record. 21.

[92] Hafiz S. A. Rehman, Sr. ASC , appeared on behalf of Respondent (s) in Civil Appeal Nos. 135 -136-P/2013 and on behalf o f all 174 persons who were issued notice vide leave granting order dated 13.06.2013. He submitted that various Regularization Acts i.e. KPK Adhoc Civil Servants (Regularization of Services) Act, 1987, KPK Adhoc Civil Servants (Regularization of Services) Ac t, 1988, KPK Employees on Contract Basis (Regularization of Services) Act, 1989, KPK Employees on Contract Basis (Regularization of Services) (Amendment) Act, 1990, KPK Civil Servants (Amendment) Act, 2005, KPK Employees (Regularization of Services) Act, 2 009, were promulgated to regularize the services of contractual employees.

[93] The Respondents , including 174 to whom he was representing , were appointed during the year  and the services of all the contractual employees were regularized through an Act of legislature i.e. KPK Civil Servants (Amendment) Act, 2005 and the KPK Employees CAs.134 -P/2013 etc 23 (Regularization of Services) Act, 2009, was not applicable to present Respondents .

[94] He referred to Section 19(2) of the KPK Civil Servants Act 1973 , which was substituted v ide KPK Civil Servants (Amendment) Act, 2005 , provides that “A person though selected for appointment in the prescribed manner t o a service or post on or after the 1st day of July, 2001, till the commencement of the said Act, but appointment on contact bas is, shall, with effect from the commencement of the said Act, be deemed to have been appointed on regular basis.” Furthermore, vide Notification dated 11.10.1989 issued by the Government of NWFP, the Governor of KPK was pleased to declare the “On Farm Wat er Management Directorate ” as an attached Department of Food, Agriculture, Livestock and Cooperation Department, Govt. of NWFP.

[95] Moreover, it was also evident from the Notification dated 03.07.2013 that 115 employees were regularized under section 19 (2) of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Civil Servants (Amendment) Act, 2005 and Regularization Act, 2009 from the date of their initial appointment. Therefore, it was a past and closed transaction.

[96] Regarding summaries submitted to the Chief Minister for creation of posts , he clarified that it was not one summary (as stated by the learned Addl. Advocate General KPK) but three summaries submitted on 11.06.2006, 04 .01.2012 and 20.06.2012 , respectively, whereby total 734 different posts of various categories were created for these employees from the regular budgetary allocation.

[97] Even through the third summary, the posts were created to regularize the employees in order to implement the judgments of Hon’ble Peshawar High Court dated 15.09.2011, 8.12.2011 and Supreme Court of Pakistan dated 22.3.2012. Approximately, 20-30% employees were CAs.134 -P/2013 etc 24 recruited through KPK Public Service Commission and the Public Service Commission is only meant to recommend the candidates on regular posts. 22.

[98] Mr. Imtiaz Ali, learned ASC , appearing on beha lf of the Respondent in CA No.134 -P/2013, submitted that there was one post of Accountant which had been created and that the Respondent , Adnanu llah, was the only Accountant who was working there. He contented that , even otherwise , judgment dated 21.9.200 9 in Writ Petition No., was not questioned before this Court and the same had attained finality.

[99] He further submitted that his Writ Petition was allowed on the strength of Writ Petition No.  and that no Appeal has been filed against it. 23. Mr. Ayub Khan, learned ASC , appeared in C.M.A 496 - P/2013 on behalf of employees whose services might be affected (to whom notices were issued by this Court vide leave granting order dated 13.06.2013) and adopted the arguments advanced by the senior lear ned counsels including Hafiz S.

[100] A. Rehman. 24. Mr. Ijaz Anwar, learned ASC , appeared in C.A 137 -P/2013 for Respondents No. 2 to 6, CPs.526 -P to 528 -P/2013 for Respondents and for Appellant in Civil Appeal No.605 -P/2015 (JR) and submitted that the Regulari zation Act of 2005 , is applicable to his case and if benefit is given to some employees then in light of the judgment of this Court titled Government of Punjab Vs.

[101] Samina Perveen (2009 SCMR 1), wherein it was observed that if some point of law is decided b y Court relating to the terms and c onditions of a Civil Servant who litigated and there were other who had not taken any legal proceedings, in such a case the dictates of justice CAs.134 -P/2013 etc 25 and rules of good governance demand that the benefit of the said decision be extended to others also who may not be parties to that litigation.

[102] Furthermore, the judgment of Peshawar High Court which included Project employees as defined under Section 19(2) of the KPK Civil Servants Act 1973 which was substituted vide KPK Civil Serv ants (Amendment) Act, 2005, was not challenged. In the NWFP Employees (Regularization of Services) Act, 2009, the Project employees have been excluded but in presence of the judgment delivered by this Court, in the cases of Govt. of NWFP vs.

[103] Abdullah Khan (ibid) and Govt. of NWFP vs. Kaleem Shah (ibid) , the Peshawar High Court had observed that the similarly placed persons should be considered for regularization. 25. While arguing Civil Appeal No. 605 -P/2015 , he submitted that in this case the Appellants / Petitioners were appointed on contract basis for a period of one year vide order dated 18.11.2007, which was subsequently extended from time to time.

[104] Thereafter, the services of the Appellants were terminated vide notice dated 30.05.2011. The learned Bench of the Peshawar High Court refused relief to the employees and observed that they were expressly excluded from the purview of Section 2(1)(b) of KPK (Regularization of Services) Act, 2009. He further contended that the Project against which they were app ointed had become part of regular Provincial B udget.

[105] Thereafter, some of the employees were regularized while others were denied , which made out a clear case of discrimination. Two groups of persons similarly placed could not be treated differently, in thi s regard he relied on the judgments of Abdul Samad vs. CAs.134 -P/2013 etc 26 Federation of Pakistan (2002 SCMR 71) and Engineer Nariandas vs.

[106] Federation of Pakistan (2002 SCMR 82). 26. We have he ard the learned Law Officer as well as the learned ASC s, representing the p arties and have gone through the relevant record with their able assistance. The controversy in these cases pivots around the issue as to whether the Respondents are governed by the provisions of the North West Frontier Province (now KPK) Employees (Regula rization of Services) Act, 2009, (hereinafter referred to as the Act).

[107] It would be relevant to reproduce Section 3 of the Act: “3. Regularization of Services of certain employees. —All employees including recommendees of the High Court appointed on contrac t or adhoc basis and holding that post on 31st December, 2008, or till the commencement of this Act shall be deemed to have been validly appointed on regular basis having the same qualification and experience.” 27.

[108] The aforesaid Section of the Act reprod uced hereinabove clearly provides for the regularization of the employees appointed either on contract basis or adhoc basis and were holding contract appointments on 31st December, 2008 or till the commencement of this Act. Admittedly, the Respondents were appointed on one year contract basis, which period of their appointments w as extended from time to time and were holding their respective posts on the cut -of date provided in Section 3 ( ibid). 28.

[109] Moreover, the Act contains a non -obstante clause in Sect ion 4A which reads as under: “4A. Overriding effect. —Notwithstanding any thing to the contrary contained in any other law or CAs.134 -P/2013 etc 27 rule for the time being in force, the provisions of this Act shall have an overriding effect and the provisions of any such law or rule to the extent of inconsistency to this Act shall cease to have effect.” 29.

[110] The above Section expressly excludes the application of any other law and declares that the provisions of the Act will have overriding effect , being a special enactment . In this background , the cases of the Respondents squarely fall within the ambit of the Act and their services were mandated to be regulated by the provisions of the Act. 30.

[111] It is also an admitted fact that the Respondents were appointed on contract basis on Project pos ts but the P rojects, as conceded by the learned Additional A dvocate General, were funded by the Provincial Government by allocating regular Provincial B udget prior to the promulgation of the Act. Almost all the P rojects were brought under the regular Provincial B udget Schemes by the Government of KPK and summaries were approved by the Chief Minster of the KPK for operating the P rojects on permanent basis.

[112] The “On Farm Water Management Project ” was brought on the regular side in the year 2006 a nd the Project was declared as an attached D epartment of the Food, Agriculture, Livestock and Co -operative Department. Likewise, other Project s were also brought under the regular Provincial B udget Scheme .

[113] Therefore, services of the Respondents would not b e affected by the language of Section 2(aa) and (b) of the Act, which could only be attracted if the Project s were abolished on the completion of their prescribed tenure. In the cases in hand, the Project s initially were introduced for a specified time w hereafter they were transferred on permanent basis by attaching them with Provincial CAs.134 -P/2013 etc 28 Government departments.

[114] The employees of the same Project were adjusted against the posts created by the Provincial Government in this behalf . 31. The record further reve als that the Respondents were appointed on contract basis and were in employment /service for several years and Project s on which they were appo inted have also been taken on the regular Budget of the Government , therefore, their status as Project employees has ended once the ir services were transferred to the different attached Govern ment D epartments, in terms of Section 3 of the Act.

[115] The Government of KPK was also obliged to treat the Respondents at par , as it cannot ad opt a policy of cherry picking to regularize the employees of certain Project s while terminat ing the services of other similarly placed employees . 32. The above are the reasons of our short order dated 24.2.2016 , which reads as under: - “Arguments heard.

[116] For the reasons to be recorded separately, these Appeals, except Civil Appeal No.6 05 of 2015, are dismissed. Judgment in Civil Appeal No.605 of 2015 is reserved” Chief Justice Judge Judge Judge Judge Islamabad the, 24-02-2016 Approved for reporting.
