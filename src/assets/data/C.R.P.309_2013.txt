[24] Mr. Makhdoom Ali Khan, l earned counsel for the petitioner Anjum Aqeel Khan in CRP No.  seeks rev iew of the impugned judgment by contending that there are errors apparent on the face of record in the judgment under review which need to be corrected; that this Court in exercise of suo moto jurisdiction cannot side step and bypass the safeguards which a re available to a party under the law in civil proceedings; that this Court during the pendency of the criminal proceedings could not make observations and record findings without recording of evidence as this would seriously prejudice the right of the pet itioner in the criminal proceedings; that by means of the judgment under review, right to fair trial as envisaged under Article 10 -A of the Constitution has been denied to the petitioner; that the petitioner cannot be declared as corrupt without recording of evidence as required under Qanoon -e- Shahadat Order, 1984 ; that in the presence of conflicting reports by the various authorities and without conducting a land audit, the petitioner cannot be directed to provide 126 kanals of land; that the cost of the l and was actually fixed by the head of the Police Foundation, which was accepted by the petitioner , rather he paid the extra amount; that the petitioner was not afforded an opportunity to confront and cross -examine the author of the report i.e. former M.D.

[27] Mr. Hamid Khan, l earned counsel for the petitioners / ex-officials of National Police Foundation / Board of Directors in CRP Nos. 310 to 312 & 349 of 2013 has contended that the officials had acted in good fait h and the alleged irregularities and illegalities cannot be attributed to the petitioners; that the petitioners cannot be held guilty by solely relying upon the report of Mr.

[28] Zafar Ahmed Qureshi, former M.D. of the National Police Foundation ; that the defi nition of ‘charitable purpose’ as appeared in Section 2 of the Charitable Endowments Act, 1890 is non -exhaustive; that the news reporter Mr. Rauf Kalasra, on whose report the suo moto action was taken, was not legally bound to appear or to file his affidav it as provided in the Supreme Court Rules ; that even he was not cross -examined by the petitioners and in such circumstances his statement could not have been relied upon by this Court.

NO. 11 OF 2011 8 been given to the petitioners; that the petitioners while discharging their duties have exercised their powers in the best interest of the Foundation for making the housing sche me successful; that the Constitution of the National Police Foundation does not restrict its Board of Directors from allotting more than one plot to any person; that there is no legal restrict ion or bar against allotment of plots by the Committee of Admini stration as a reward for good service by its employees who fell within the definition of beneficiaries or allotment of plots to the relatives of the employees of the NPF; that under Section 18 of the NAB Ordinance, 1999, only the Chairman of NAB or the per son duly authorized by him is empowered to take a decision regarding initiation of proceedings against anyone; that petitioners in the earlier investigation conducted by the FIA had been declared innocent by the Special Judge Central and holding them guilt y amounts to violation of Article 13 of the Constitution which inter alia provides that a person could not be prosecuted or punished for the same offence twice and that the judgment under review is liable to be reviewed on the points mentioned above. 4.

[31] Learned counsel for the petitioners / allottees of the plots Syed Ali Zafar in CRP Nos. 320, 321, 323 to 327, 348 & 378 of 2013 has submitted that the petitioners had purchased the plots from National Police Foundation about 25 years ago when the area was totally undeveloped and barren and in fact the Foundation was not in possession of any land; that in spite C.R.P.

[34] Regarding the issue whether the public or other family member s of a police officer could purchase the plo ts, learned counsel contended that there is no such law in which an individual is stopped from owning property and the Court in coming to the conclusion that the family members of a police officer were not entitled to purchase the plots, had acted unlawful ly.

[35] According to him, the only question was as to whether the market value was paid or not . Learned counsel further added that none of the ingredients which are sine qua non for the exercise of jurisdiction by this Court under Article 184(3) of the Constit ution are present ; that the scheme s in which petitioners have purchased the plots at market price were not for the welfare of the serving or retired persons in the Police Force but C.R.P.

No.  and learned counsel for the applicants in CMA Nos. 2334, 2338, 2343, 2347 & 2351 of 2014 have made almost similar prayers. According to them they were bona fide purchasers for consideration and their allotment has been cancelled without notice ; that the petitioners/applicant s were neither heard nor were made party; that the petitioners have unblemished service record and they have never misused or have ever transgressed their authority; that the allotment of plots in their favour was through a transparent and lawful manner an d was in accordance with the relevant rules which were in vogue that time and that after a considerable long period in a suo moto jurisdiction, the legality of the allotment cannot be disputed. 6.

[41] In view of the above, they have prayed for setting aside of the judgment under review. 7. Learned counsel for the National Police Foundation , on the other hand, has inter alia contended that the Housing Schemes were established on commercial basis; that it was not mentioned anywhere in the ap plication form that other family members cannot apply; that the schemes were launched to generate funds as the Foundation was facing acute shortage of funds. 8.

NO. 11 OF 2011 12 9. It is on record that National Police Foundation has been established in the year 1975 under Charitable Endowment Act, 1890 .

[44] The main purpose for its establishment was to provide relief to t he poor police officials of throughout the country in the shape of medical, education, one time grant, artificial limbs, scholarships, dowry, vocational training centres etc. Word ‘charitable purpose’ has been defined in Section 2 of the Act which includes relief of the poor, education, medical relief and the advancement of any other object of general public utility, but does not include a purpose which relates exclusively to religious teaching or worship .

[45] As such the benefit could be given only to poor who are entitled to have share from charity. No one has argued that the NPF was not a charitable institution. We have noticed that the Committee of Administration of the NPF has framed rules according to their own choice irrespective of the scope of the Chari table Endowments Act under which the charitable institution was formed aiming at welfare and benefit of poor and needy police officials of all over the country.

[46] The NPF has deviated from the basic purpose of charitable for which it was established. So far as the question as to whether the NPF was authorized to launch private housing schemes for the general public is concerned, it has been discussed at length in the main judgment that the Foundation could do so only for the help of beneficiaries but not for private persons or officers / officials of other departments under the garb of beneficiaries .

We have noted that only the in fluential persons have got ten the benefit of the schemes launched by the Foundation and the needy poor police officials have been deprived of their right.

[49] The argument that the schemes were launched only to generate funds is a belated argument just to save the skin. Such valuable plots have been squandered only to favour the higher police officers and other persons as also to their family members who were not at all entitled to the allotment of plots. Even the balloting was not done.

[50] If generation of funds was the main purpose, then the plots should have to be sold in open market so as to get maximum price. It was for these reasons that we have observed in the main judgment that “in the garb of such objectives of the National Police Foundation the administra tion of the NPF decided to enrich their own pockets and to dole away the plots to the higher police officials and other higher government officials for a consideration which was not inconsonance with the market price prevailing at that time .” We had also t aken note of the fact that no criterion for allotment of plots was made and had observed in para 38 of the impugned judgment as under: - “The Board of Directors of the Foundation while establishing housing schemes did not at all fix the criterion by making bye-laws / terms and conditions for allotment of plots in the housing schemes and divided plots to their nears and dears without there being any logic for such allotments.

[51] Even the Board of Directors did not frame any rules / bye -laws for allotment of plot s to the general public and allotted plot to the persons of their choice without having published in the newspapers the C.R.P.

The plots in the said scheme were also not put to auction in accordance with law by the Board of Directors, as such, the Board of Directors has been utilizing the foundation for their personal gains for the benefit of their nears and dears.” It is correct that plots could be allotted to the officials/ employees by the Committee of Administ ration but in all the process impartiality should be the most important factor, which as discussed above, was unfortunately found lacking in the instant process, which led to initiation of suo moto proceedings.

[53] In the main judgment, a list has been provide d according to which more than one plot has been allotted to several police & government officials as also to other civilians . Some of the families were allotted five plots and some were allotted more than ten plots. In one case, an NPF employee was allott ed 8 plots by the Foundation.

[54] There is a long list of police officials and even others who got two or more than two plots. Not only this, several plots have been allotted to family members of police officials. Some of the plots were even given at the rate of Rs.100/ -. If for the sake of arguments we admit that the schemes were launched only to generate funds, then why several plots were allotted on a cheaper price of Rs.100/ -.

[55] This clearly establishes that there was some mala fide on the part of the Foundat ion. For ready reference the list is reproduced as under: - Srl.

[103] The above list clearly prove s that the Manag ement of the NPF have allotted plots to the police officials not only over and above their entitlement but certain civilians of their choice as well as military officials have been allotted plots, who even do not fall within the definition of the beneficia ries as discussed earlier.

[104] Even the possibility cannot be ruled out that the officials sitting at the helm of affairs in the NPF have not provide d the complete list and have concealed many of other identical cases. So far as the argument of learned counsel that none of the ingredients for the exercise of suo moto jurisdiction by this Court are present in these proceedings is concerned, we have C.R.P.

NO. 11 OF 2011 23 found that it is a classic case of public importance where loot - sale of plots was going on in the name of generatio n of funds depriving the deserving poor police officials and the same squarely fell within the ambit of Article 184(3) of the Constitution.

[107] This Court has full powers to take suo moto action in such like cases of public importance. 11. So far as the case of Anjum Aqeel Khan is concerned, during the pendency of the proceedings at the time of hearing of S.M.C. No.  , the matter was inquired into by Mr. Zafar Ahmed Qureshi, Ex -M.D. of NPF.

[108] In the said inquiry not only Anjum Aqeel Khan was associated bu t the concerned officials of the NPF were also associated. Anjum Aqeel Khan not only admitted lapses on his part but also entered into agreements with the Foundation so as to make the loss good. These agreements are on record and are reproduced in the main judgment.

[109] If he had not done any wrong or he was not involved, then why he admitted his lapses and entered into agreements with the Foundation. Even learned counsel for Anjum Aqeel Khan at the time of hearing of main case, in his CMA bearing No.  while summing up his arguments had also stated that Anjum Aqeel Khan is ready and willing to abide by the terms of the settlement agreement signed by him with the NPF.

[110] Due to this reason, we had directed Chairman NAB to initiate proceedings against the de linquent persons as also against Anjum Aqeel Khan. One of the argument s raised by learned counsel was that Mr. Rauf Kalasra (journalist) on whose C.R.P. NOs. 309 TO 312, 320, 321, 323 TO 327, 348, 349, 354 TO 356, 361, 362, 364 TO 36 6, 373, 377, 378, 357 To 360, 363, 367 TO 372, 374 TO 376 OF 2013 AND 31 TO 33, 49 TO 54 OF 2014 AND C.M.A.

[112] He had appeared at the asking of the Court in order to do complete justice and the impugned judgment was not passed only on his statement. It was the matter of great public importance, which compelled this Court to pass the impu gned judgment. So far as the argument raised that under Section 18 of the National Accountability Bureau Ordinance, 1999, only the Chairman NAB or the person duly authorized by him is empowered to take a decision regarding initiation of proceedings against anyone is concerned, it is stated that this Court under Article 184(3) of the Constitution has very vast powers and if this Court considers that a question of public importance with reference to the enforcement of any of the fundamental rights conferred b y the Constitution is involved, it has jurisdiction to pass appropriate orders.

[113] In Muhammad Yasin Vs. Federation of Pakistan through Secretary Establishment Division (2012 PLD 132) petitioner filed a direct petition before this Court assailing appointment of respondent as Chairman OGRA. This Court declared the appointment of respondent as void ab initio and directed the NAB to proceed in the matter of serious allegations enumerated in the Constitution petition including those enumerated in the judgment and the conduct of State functionaries who were engaged in the process of selection of respondent as Chairman OGRA.

Nati onal Accountability Bureau through Chairman (2014 PLD 109, Quetta) petitioner was civil servant who was found involved in embezzlement and the Service Tribunal had referred the matter to NAB for initiation of proceedings.

[116] The petitioner challenged the said order before the Balochistan High Court with the contention that cognizance of any offence could only be taken on a reference made by the Chairman NAB and as such proceedings initiated on the directions of Service Tribunal were coram non judice . The learn ed High Court has held that anybody or any authority could inform the NAB that a person was involved in an offence and such information could be termed as complaint and that NAB authorities could initiate proceedings against a person on its own accord, onl y on coming to know about an offence from any source, including a reference received from government or upon receipt of a complaint.

[117] Such information could also be gathered from a judgment or order of Tribunal or Court, forming basis to initiate proceeding s by the Chairman NAB on its own accord. One of the points raised by learned counsel was that the impugned judgment amount s to violation of Article 13 of the Constitution as vide the judgment the Board of Directors / employees have been held guilty.

[118] The apprehension of learned counsel is misconceived. We have not declare d any person as guilty but have only referred the matter to NAB to investigate the matter fairly, justly and in accordance with law. If someone is not guilty, he should not have any fear in C.R.P. NOs. 309 TO 312, 320, 321, 323 TO 327, 348, 349, 354 TO 356, 361, 362, 364 TO 36 6, 373, 377, 378, 357 To 360, 363, 367 TO 372, 374 TO 376 OF 2013 AND 31 TO 33, 49 TO 54 OF 2014 AND C.M.A.

[120] However, it is made clear that all the observations made in these proceedings are tentative in nature and NAB or any other investiga ting agency will proceed against the delinquent persons strictly on merit without being influenced by any observations made in these proceedings. 12. We have noticed that at the time of hearing of main case, the case of the persons who have been allotted more than one plot was that they were dependents of the police officers .

[121] However, in these proceedings they have taken a different stance that there was no mention in the application form that the family member of a police officer could not purchase the plots and that they have purchased the plots in their own capacity. However, the NPF has admitted that they were beneficiaries.

[122] As we have discussed above, the main purpose for the establishment of NPF was to provide relief to the poor and deserving police officials of all over the country and not to only higher and influential persons as also to their families . The purpose could be justly and fairly met if only one plot was allotted to only deserving police officials , but unfortunately the same has not been done.

[123] All what has been done in the name of generation of funds and charity is nothing but a sever e and gross illegality. 13. There are three categories of persons in this case. First, where the persons were allotted only one plot. C.R.P. NOs. 309 TO 312, 320, 321, 323 TO 327, 348, 349, 354 TO 356, 361, 362, 364 TO 36 6, 373, 377, 378, 357 To 360, 363, 367 TO 372, 374 TO 376 OF 2013 AND 31 TO 33, 49 TO 54 OF 2014 AND C.M.A.

NO. 11 OF 2011 27 There are further two sub categories in the first category. In first type police officers / officials or employees of the Foundation have been allotted only one plot each and in second type, civilians, bureaucrats, army personnels etc have been allotted only one plot each.

[125] Second, where the persons were allotted more than one plot either in their name s or in the names of their family members. Third, where the persons have purchased plots from the original allottees (subsequent allottees) . 14. So far as the second category is c oncerned, for what has been discussed above , more than one plot allotted to any person and his family members shall stand cancelled.

[126] However, if they want to retain the plots, they can pay the market price of the plots, which shall be determined by the Com mission , detail of which is given in the last paragraph of this judgment . 15. So far as first sub-category in the first category i.e. police officers and employees of Foundation who have been allotted only one plot is concerned, we are persuaded to hold that they can keep the plots .

[127] Though we have found several illegalities in the process of allotment of plots but in the interest of justice, we are not going to cancel their allotment . There is some justification for allotment of plots to them. 16. So fa r as second sub-category in the first category i.e. civilians, bureaucrats, army personnels etc is concerned, they were not at all entitled for the allotment of plots .

[128] Hence their allotment is cancelled . However, if they want to retain the C.R.P.

NO. 11 OF 2011 28 plots, they can pay the market price thereof, which shall be determined by the Commission. The other person(s) who had been allotted only one plot and subsequently they have transferred it in the name of their family members also fall in this category. 17.

[130] However, so far as the subsequent purchasers / bona fide purchasers are concerned, it would be harsh if their plots are cancelled. Many of them have built houses. After a passage of more than 10 years, depriving them of the plots and the houses constructed thereon will be a grave miscarriage of justice.

[131] They have acted in good faith and they are lawful owners in possession of the plots and the market value of the property at present has reached a stage mainly on account of the development and construction by them. They have purchased the plots from the original allottees after having undergone a thorough process of due verification and paid the marke t price prevailing at that time.

[132] If the original allottees had not turned up or had not fulfilled their obligations, the bona fide purchasers cannot be attributed any mala fide. If at all, any amount is to be paid, that should be paid by the original allottees, who are established to have gained unlawfully or who are the beneficiaries of undue enrichment. 18.

[133] Learned couns el for the petitioners in the review petitions as also CMAs filed by Anjum Aqeel Khan and the persons who were allotted more than one plot either in their name or their family members have tried to reargue the case, C.R.P. NOs. 309 TO 312, 320, 321, 323 TO 327, 348, 349, 354 TO 356, 361, 362, 364 TO 36 6, 373, 377, 378, 357 To 360, 363, 367 TO 372, 374 TO 376 OF 2013 AND 31 TO 33, 49 TO 54 OF 2014 AND C.M.A.

[134] NOs. 1059, 1063, 2334, 2338, 2343, 2347, 2351, 2353 OF 2014 IN C.R.P. NOs. NIL OF 2014 IN S.M.C. NO. 11 OF 2011 AND C.M.A. NO. 1429 OF 2015 IN C.R.P . NO. NIL OF 2015 IN S.M.C. NO. 11 OF 2011 29 which cannot be allowed in review jurisd iction. Same is the case with the petitioners / applicants who were allotted only one plot but without any entitlement i.e. civilians, bureaucrats, army personnels etc.

[135] As such the review petitions as also CMAs filed by Anjum Aqeel Khan and the persons who were allotted more than one plo t as also the petitioners / applicants who were allotted only one plot but without any entitlement i.e. civilians, bureaucrats, army personnels etc are dismissed. However, we have observed that there is strong case of bona f ide purchasers/ subsequent allottees.

[136] Consequently , the review petitions as also CMAs filed by the bona fide purchasers/subsequent allottees as also the persons who were allotted only one plot i.e. police officers/officials and employees of Foundation are d isposed of. It is directed that a Commission headed by Mr. Justice Moulvi Anwar -ul-Haq, former Judge of the Lahore High Court , be constituted, which shall determine the cases of subsequent purchasers / bona fide purchasers from the original allottees as to how can the market price of the plots be determined and recovery can be made from the original allottee of the difference between the allotment price and the market price of the land.

[137] The Commission shall submit its report, for our perusal in Chambers, wi thin a period of two months after the date of formation. The Commission shall also consider the cases of persons who fall in the second sub-category of first category who have been allotted only one plot as to whether they had paid the C.R.P.

The Commission is further directed to consider the cases of persons who fall in the second category , detail of which has been given in para 14 above, as to what is the market p rice and how it can be recovered .

[140] The fee and other allowances of the Commission shall be determined by the NPF after discussing with the Hon’ble former Judge. The National Police Foundation is directed to provide full assistance /facilities to the Commissi on either in the shape of provision of office and staff or conveyance facility or in any other form and all the relevant record shall be made available to the Commission.

[141] The Commission will settle/propose the terms and steps as to how the judgm ent of this Court can be complied with. CHIEF JUSTICE JUDGE JUDGE Islamabad, Announced on ______________ __ Approved For Reporting Khurram `
