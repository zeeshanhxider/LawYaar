Date of Hearing JUDGMENT Syed Hasan Azhar Rizvi, J.- Through this petition, filed under Article 212(3) of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 (the Constitution), the petitioner has challenged the judgment dated 21.12.2020 (impugned judgment) of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Service Tribunal, Peshawar whereby the service appeal filed by the petitioner under section 4 of the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Service Tribunal Act, 1974 was dismissed C.P.

[3] No.546 of 2021 2. Before delving into the intricate details of the case, let us first provide a concise overview of the key facts and events as per the petition that set the stage for these legal proceedings.2 The petitioner was formally appointed as an Assistant Composite Wood Officer (BS-17) in the Pakistan Forest Institute, Peshawar (“PFIP”) with effect from 14.01.2008 olde Notification No. 1(21)/2008-A-III(PFI) dated 30.06.2008 of the Ministry of Environment, Government of Pakistan.

[4] Due to life threats from the Taliban, the petitioner was transferred and posted as Section Officer (BS-17), Ministry of Environment, on deputation basis, for a period of three years vide Notification No . F./ 2009-OMG-II dated 3 1 . 10.2009 of Cabinet Secretariat, Establishment Division, Government of Pakistan.

[5] Meanwhile, the Constitution (Eighteenth Amendment) Act, 2010 was passed and the Ministry of Environment was devolved to the Provinces; resultantly, the PFIP was devolved to the Government of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK) on 30.06.2011 along with entire staff irrespective of their province of domicile and even without affording them any option or choice vide Notification No.3- -Admin-I dated 30.05.201 1 . 3.

[6] After Revolution, the petitioner was never asked to join the PFIP under tHe Administrative control of the Government of KPK and continued to b,,„e a, a S,,tion Office, (BS-17) in the Minist,y of Environment. Lat+r, his services were placed at the disposal of the Petroleum and Naturat Resources Division vide Establishment Division’s Notinc&tion No.F./2008-OMG-II dated 12.02.2011.

[7] Sub,,qu„,tly, h, wa, t,an,f„„d and p,,t,d a, a S,,ti,n OfR,,, in the Ministry of Information Technology oMe Notification No.1- -Admn. dated 19.04.2012. The petitioner was repatriated to \ \ C.P. No.546 of 20213 his parent depart bent PFIP with immediate effect vide Notification No.F./2009-dMG-II dated 19.11.20 13 of the Cabinet Secretariat Establishment Dikision, Government of Pakistan.

[8] However, this notification was withd,aw„ sub,,q„„,tly „d, N,tin,ation NO.F./2009-dMG-II dated 01.01.2014. The petitioner was again repatriated to hRs parent department vide notification dated 24.02.2015 of thb Establi,hm,nt Divi,i,n (Ma„ag,m,nt S,,,i,,s Wing), Governmebt of Pakistan. The petitioner impugned this Notification by nlihg a constitution petition under Article 199 of the Constitution befo+ the Islamabad High Court, Islamabad but could not succeed.

[9] An INtra court appeal as well as Civil Petition for leave to appeal filed by the petitioner also met the same fate. 4. MeanWhile, the Government of KPK on 10.12.2015, initiated a discipl+n,ry inqui,y again,t th, p,titi,n„ f,, hi, all,g,d willful absence fr+m duty and issued him a charge sheet with the statement ,f all,4ati,n,.

[10] Finally, th, p,titi,n,, wa, „m,,,d f„m service vide Notification SO(Estt)/FE&WD/V- dated 09.11.2018 (impqgned notification) of the Forest, Environment & Wildlife Departm4nt, Government of KPK. The petitioner filed a service appeal/r4presentation against the impugned nodncation b,f,r, th, ,,mp,+nt a„,th,,ity but th, ,am, wa, n,t d,,id,d within the stipulated pe[iod.

[11] The petitioner as such preferred an appeal under section 4 +f the Khyber Pakhtunkhwa Service Tribunal Act, 1974 against th+ impugned notification but failed; hence, this petition . 5. The l+arned counsel for the petitioner has argued that the KPK Service Tribunal while passing the impugned judgment could not proper+ have appreciated that a civil servant could not at \ C.P.

[12] No.546 of 202 14 his sweet will relirbuish the charge of his office unless allowed by the C,mp,t,nt A„,th,+ty and in th, ,a,, ,f th, p,titioner the Ministry of Inf,,mad,n T,,dn,I,gy ,,ntin„„„„ly ,,mm„,ni,at,d with the Establishment Dhvision as well as the PFIP and in such ,i„um,tan,,, th4, wa, n, ju,tin,ati,n f,, initiati,n ,f di,,iplinary proceedings again+t the petitioner.

[13] Further argbed that the learned tribunal did not consider that the p,titi,n,, wag p,,,,,d,d again,t ,x-parte and was not afforded the opportunity od personal hearing as required under Article 10-A of the Constitution +hile he was performing duties in the Ministry of Information Tech4ology of the Federal Government; hence, there was no need to get p+blish notices in the newspapers.

[14] The PFIP could have only made a request to the Ministry of Information Technology to relieve the pbtitioner from his duties to join PFIP or the Government of K+K or the inquiry committee may request the said Ministry to reljeve the petitioner. Whereas, the petitioner continuously infodmed the PFIP about the develdpments of extensions ,f hi, d,putati,4 p„i,d a, w,11 a, th„at, b,ing fa,,d by th, petitioner due to +hich he was unable to join the PFIP at the cost of his life.

[15] Add, that t+, p,titi,n,, i, a vi,tim of arbitrariness, maIa Bdes, ,,gani,ati,nal +i,manag,m,nt and improper perception of provisions of the law between the Federal Government and the Government of dPK after the devolution of function and powers under the ConstiFution (Eighteenth Amendment) Act, 2010, which resulted in the reboval from service of the petitioner.

[16] Lastly argqed that the petitioner has already attained the status of a Federdl Government employee prior to the issuance of the \ C.P. No.546 of 202 15 imp„gn,d n,tin,aFi,n in t„m, ,f th, Ci,iI S,rvant (Amendments) Act, 2016 and as #uch the PFIP could not initiate an inquiry against him. 6. C,n,,[,,ly, th, 1,a,n,d Law Offi,,rs (except r,,pondent N,.5) ,t,ongly subp,,t,d th, imp„gn,d judgment and notification and contended dhat it deserves to be upheld calling for no interference thereIn.

[17] However, Ministry of Information Technology („,p,nd,nt N,.5) by aIling a ,,pa,at, CMA ,„,pport,d th, v,r,i,n ,f the petitioner w+h the assertions that the PFIP, an attached department of the defunct Ministry of Environment, was devolved to the Government of KPK under the Constitution ( Eighteenth Am„,dm„,t) A,t, 2010.

[18] The PFIP i,,u,d 1,tt„ N,.759/F.KP,,)-E,tt, dated 29.05.2014 and No.923/F. I(Per)-Estt dated 23.06.2014 to the petitioner to redort for duty at PFIP. Later, the Ministry of Information Techhology, through an office memorandum dated 22.10.2014 t, t+, D,,,luti,n C,11 ,f th, D,f„,n,t Mini,t,y ,f E„vi,o„m,nt Cat,Fn,t Divi,i,n ,,qu,,t,d to allow th, p,tition,, to continue his servi bes in the Federal Secretariat in the public interest.

[19] Further asserted that the Ministry of Information Technology management did +ot relieve the petitioner because the working of the Ministry in gener+1 and the development wing, in particular, could have been serious+y impacted. 7. We hhve heard the rival submissions of the learned counsel for the detitioner as w,11 as the learned Law Officers and p,FUsed th, ,,I,v4nt mat,,ial a„ailabl, ,n the record. 8.

[20] After the Constitution ( Eighteenth Amendment) Act, 2010, the Federal Secretariat was reorganized and the office/organizatio4 of Pakistan Forests Institute, Peshawar along with C.P. No.546 of 202 16 its employees wd,e t,a„,ferred to the Government of KPK on deputation basis +nder section 10 of the Civil Servant Act, 1973.

[21] In this regard, a +ormal Notification No.3-–Admn-I dated 30.05.2011 was igsued by the Ministry of Environment, Government of Pakistan and a list of the transferee employees was also attached thereto wherein tHe name of the present petitioner was mentioned at serial no.35 with the designation as “Assistant Composite Wood Officer (Presently ;ewing as Section Officer in Federal Secretariat on d,p„tati,n ba,i,”+ N,n,th,1,,,, th, p,titi,ner did not assume the charge of his dut bs at PFIP under the above-mentioned notification as he, at that Umd, was serving as a Section Officer in the Ministry of Environment. on Reputation basis, for a period of three years, uMe Notification NO.F.h/-OMG-II. dated 31.10.2009 of Cabinet Secretariat Establishment Division, Government of Pakistan. 9.

[22] Mean+hile, the Environment Department, KPK wrote a letter to the Fede b1 Government qua the clarification of the status of th, at,ov, ,„,ploybe, t,an,f,,,,d by it a, a ,,q„,el to th, d,vol„,tion und„ th, c,nstbtution (Eight,,nth Amendment) Act, 2010. The ,e,p,nse of the F+d,,al G,v,,nment ,ega,ding the status of the said employees was co+ve),ed to the Environment Department through the Establishment & Admin.

[23] Department (ReWlation Wing) of the G,v,,nm,nt ,f K+K „ id, N,tincation No.SO(O&M)n&AD/ 1-- Vol-IV dated 13.1+.2011 in the following terms: “As a result o/ devolution, aU the employees o/ deuozded Ministries/ Departments have been posted in Federhl/ Provincial/AJK Governments on deputation under section 10 o/ the CitIit SeruarLt Act, 1973.

[24] As decid4d by the Federa1 Cabinet, legislation for p,,mAn,nt ab,,,pd,n ,f th,,, ,mpI,y,e, is yet to be pm,d,,d. In th, m,ar,tim,, th, employees of the deuozded Ministries/ Departments shall continue to C.P. No.546 of 202 17 ,„„k ,h dep„tati„, Jo, th, p,,bd a, admissible under the ru&s. Since, the employees o/ PFI are on deputation, therefdre, rules & regulations pertaining to their sendce are goberned by ruLes and regulations of the Federal GoverXmerLt and such like cases may be referred to Estabt\shrrterLt Diuision for NHher disposal.” 10.

[25] Depu btion within a government department holds a ,ig„in,ant ,,1,, n,,,,,itating r,,ruitment under exceptional circumstances when there is a lack of expertise within the depa,t„,ent in th+ ,elevant ,„,bject o, field. In such situations, the prescribed procedure outlined in Rule 20-A of the Civil Servants (Appointment, Prbmotion, and Transfer) Rules, 1973, must be adhered to.

[26] HoweVer, it is imperative to emphasize that deputation should not entail an indefinite period of service but should conform to the specified duration fo, the deputation. The normal period of d,put,ti,n i, th„+ y,a„ ,nd th, ,,n,„n,d ,fn,,r h,, t, r,p,rt ba,k aft,, ,,mpI,ti,n ,F hi, th„, y,a,, p,,i,d unI,,, it ha, been extended to further two ye4s and the maximum period is five years in terms of Serial No.27 (iv) df ESTA Code Volume-1 (Civil Establishment Code), whe,eby both the b,„,wing and lending ,,ganization should ensure immediate repatribuon of the deputationist.

[27] Furthermore, the period ,f d,putati,n haq t, b, d,fin,d ,p,,in,ally and after expiry of the said period, the bfncer should automatically be relieved from his .fn„ d„ti„, u„14„ hi, p„i,d h,, b„n ,xtended. The other pre- conditions of dedutation referred in Chapter III (Transfer, Posting, and Deputation) oF the ESTA Code, are as under: O Wh,,d a p,,t p„p,,,d t, b, y,it,d i, r,,,r„ed und,r the rates for departmental promotion, appointment on dep„t&t i,n may b, made ,ny if the department certifAs that no eligible person is available for promol jon or the eligible person is found uNIt for promojion by the appropriate DPC/ Selection Board.

[28] In C.P. No.546 of 202 18 such ckses, deputation may be approved tia such time a su{t4bze person becomes auailable for promotion. In ca4e of posts reserued for initial recruitment, appoiNtment on deputation may be made only as tempo\ary arrangement, pending joining of the nomlabe of the FPSC, and subject to the condition that such appointment shall be made only after a re@is+tion has been placed with the FPSC.

[29] In casbs where a post is tenabte through appointment by debutation, the normal period of deputation should be th4e years and no extension beyond three years may be allowed without prior approual of the Establishment Division. No o/dcer should be sent on deputation unless he has conpJ+ted three years' seruice in his parent depa4ment aPer return from an earlier deputation. "(ii) (Ut) (iV) 11.

[30] We 4ay mention here that the deputationist by no stretch of the ihagination and in the absence of any specific provision of law c+n ask to se,„e the total pe,iod of d,putation and he ,an be repatriate+ b,ing a d,putati,ni,t by th, C,mp,t,nt Autho,ity in the int,re,t bf e„ig,n,y of ,,PVi,, a, and wh,n ,o de,i,ed and ,u,h ,,d,, ,+ th, ,,mp,t,nt a„,th,,ity ,ann,t b, qu,,ti,n,d.

[31] Th, Civil Servants Acl, 1973 and the rules made there-under as well as ESTACODE are sFlent about the fact that a deputationist must serve hi, ,nd„ p,,i,d ,f d,putati,n and thi, ,mi,,i,n ,,,m, d,lib„at, enabling the Cdmpetent Authority to utilize the service of an employee in the banner as it may deem nt and proper.

[32] The period of deputation can 4t best be equated to that of an expression of the maximum perio+ which can be curtailed or extended by the C,mp,t,nt A„,th+,ity and n, 1,gal ,, v,,t,d rights whatsoever are availabl, to a d,Hutationi,t to ,,r„, hi, ,nti,, period of d,p„,tatio„ in the borrowing Dbpartment.

[33] In this regard, we are fortified by the dictum laid dowb by this Court in the cases reported as C.P. No.546 of 202 19 Khan u. Chief E+qineer (1998 SCMR 2419); AsZam Warraich u. Secretary, manniNg and Development Division (1991 SCMR 2330); Pakistan u. FazaZ-krRehman (PLD 1959 sc (Pak.) 82); Ashraf Khan Mad v.

[34] Chairman\Board of Governors AUama Iqbal Medical College (2003 PLC (C.S.1 243); Dr. Sha.R-ur-RehmarLAfridi u. C.D.A (2010 SCMR 378) and S. Masood Abbas Rizvi u. Federation of Pakistan (2014 SCMR 799 12. In thi+ case, the initial deputation period of 3 years of the petitioner was ex$ired on Ol.11.2012.

[35] From the record, it is evident that a process w4s start,d f,r th, ,xt,n,i,n ,f th, d,p„,tati,n p„i,d but was not exte4ded fu,the, by the comp,tent auth,,ity. The law is very much clear b this r,ga,d that ,n th, la,t dat, ,f th, ,p,,in,d period, the offi,e+ ,h„,Id aut,mad,ally ,ta„d „Ii,„,d ,f hi, dud,, unless the ord,rg ,f th, ,,mp,t,nt ,„,th,,ity ha„, b,,n ,btain,d in advance for ,x+„ding th, p„i,d. rS,, S,,taI N,.28-A .f th, ESTACODE VoZudeJ (Civil Establishment Code).

[36] The PFIP, no doubt, made construct de efforts by issuing 1,tt,,, No.759/F.I(Pe,)-E,tt, dated 29.05.201+, and No.923/F.I(Per)-Estt dated 23.06.2014 to apprise the p,dti+n„ ab,ut th, ,f,„-n,t,d 1,gal p,,iti,n qua ,xpi,y of his initial p,,iad of d,putatio„ and to di,,,t him to ,,po,t fo, duty at PFIP but he ohitted to join his duty for no reason.

[37] Later on, the petitioner, by vir 4ue of newly added sub-sections (3), (4), (5) & (6) of ,,,ti,n 3 „M, Ci,iI S ,,,ant, ( Am„,dm,nt) O,dina„,,, 2013 promulgated on 24.05.2013 and followed by the Civil Servants (Am„,dm,nt) A,1 2016, a,,um,d th, ,tatu, ,f th, ,i,il ,,,,ant ,f th, Government of qPK. Being so, the petitioner, for the first time, was officially repatri4ted to his parent department PFIP with immediate effect by the Cabinet Secretariat, Establishment Division, Government of +akistan oMe Notification No.F./2009-OMG-11 \, C.P.

Nevertheless, the petitioner wa# again ,,pat,iat,d t, hi, pa,,nt d,pa,t„,ent „d, notification dateb 24.02.2015 of the Establishment Division (Management Sebices Wing), Government of Pakistan.

[39] Instead of joining his pare+t depa,tm,nt i.,.

An Intra court appe4 as well as a Civil P,titi,n f,, 1,a,, t, app,al HI,d by the petitioner 4lso met the same fate. 13.

[40] Havidg exhaust,d all th, a,ailabl, 1,gal „,,„„,,s, th, parent departme bt, on 10.12.2015, ,ightly initiated a di,ciplina,y inquiry under Ru+e 10(1)(a) of the Government Servants (Efficiency & Discipline) Rules, 2011 against the petitioner for his alleged willful absence from tHe duty by i,,„,ing him a ,ha,g, ,he,t with a statement of auqgations.
