[8] The Convict has challenged his conviction and sentence by filing the instant Jail Petition No.269 of 2017 . On 27 September 2023 the complai nant appearing in person stated that he is not in a position to engage a lawyer and further stated that the legal heirs of both the deceased have pardoned the Convict and they are not interested to further purs ue the matter.

[9] On the above date , learned counsel for the petitioner and the learned Deputy Prosecutor General were directed to assist the complainant with regard to the procedure for entering into compromise and submission of application for acceptance of compromise but on the subsequent dates no compromise document s were submitted by the complainant . 4.

[10] After hearing learned counsel for the petitioner and learned Additional Prosecutor General, Punjab we have perused the available record. It is the case of the prosecution that on 2 September 2013 at about 9 pm when PW.1 0 alongwith his relative s Hafeezullah Khan (PW.12) and Mohsin Ali Khan (not produced at the trial) were sitting in his house, they heard noise from the house of deceased Hassan Jaleel.

[11] They rushed and on reaching the house of deceas ed Hassan Jaleel they saw the convict armed with .30 bore pistol present in the courtyard of deceased Hassan Jaleel . The Convict was having altercation with deceased Hassan Jaleel and Taj Begum as to why they had tethered their cattle and built gutter on h is land.

[12] The Convict warned PWs not to come forward. In the meanwhile, the Convict fired with .30 bore pistol upon deceased Hassan Jaleel which hit on his back. When his wife Mussarat Shaheen came forward to rescue her husband the Convict fired upon her ar m and abdomen . When deceased Taj Begum tried t o run away, the Convict fired upon her and she received firearm injury on her back.

[13] After receiving firearm injuries , both the deceased and the injured fell on the ground while the convict fled from the spot. 5. FIR of the occurrence was promptly lodged by PW.10 who is relative of the deceased, injured as well as the convict . Record does not reveal of any motive on the part of PW.10 and PW.12, being eye witnesses of the occurrence to falsely implicate the convi ct.

[14] JP No. 269 of 2017 3 6. The unshaken and confidence inspiring testimony of eye witnesses i.e. PW.10, PW.12 and unshaken testimony of injured witness Mussarat Shaheen (PW.11 ) duly corroborated by the medico legal evidence , recovery of crime empties from the place of occurr ence, blood stained clothes of the decease d and injured, blood stains collected from the place of occurrence, reports of the chemical expert/serologist, recovery of crime weapon on the pointation of the convict supported by positive report of the firearm e xpert of the Punjab Forensic Science Agency proves the charge against the convict beyond reasonable doubt. 7.

[15] In order to de termine the quantum of sentence each case has to be judged upon its own facts and circumstances . According to settled princ iples of law, a single mitigating circumstance, available in the particular case, would be sufficient to put a Judge on guard for not awarding the penalty of death but imprisonment for life. 8.

[16] In the instant case though the complainant and legal heirs of the dec eased have not filed compromise documents but the complainant has made statement before this Court on 27 February 2023 that the legal heirs of both the deceased have pardoned the convict and they are not interested to further pursue the matter. 9.

[17] The abo ve circumstance coupled with motive of the occurrence and altercation of the convict with the deceased prior to the occurrence are considered as mitigating circumstances to reduce the sentence of death of the convict u/s 302(b) PPC as Ta’zir to imprisonmen t for life. For the above reasons drawn today , the Jail Petition of 269 of 2017 was converted into appeal and same was partly allowed by us vide short order dated 22 May 2024 in the terms which read as follows: “For reasons to be recorded later, this peti tion is converted into an appeal and is partly allowed.

[18] The conviction awarded to the petitioner under section 302(b) of the Pakistan Penal Code, 1860 (‘PPC’) is maintained, however his sentence of death on two counts is converted to that of imprisonment f or life. The compensation of Rs.500,000/ - each awarded to the appellant on two counts is maintained.
