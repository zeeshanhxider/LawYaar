[1] order of Lahore High Court, Lahore dated 04.02.2020 passed in WP No.67 of 2020) Attiq ur Rehman ...…. Petitioner(s) Versus Sh. Tahir Mehmood and others ….Respondent(s) For the petitioner(s): Dr. G.M. Choudhary, ASC. Respondent(s): N.R. Date of hearing: 26.01.2023 ORDER Syed Mansoor Ali Shah, J.- Respondent No.1 through a constitutional petition challenged the initiation of inquiry against him on the charges of which he already stood exonerated in three previous inquiries.

[2] He contended before the High Court that the Chief Minister’s Inspection Team has no authority to initiate the said inquiry against him. On the basis of these submissions the High Court issued notices to other side and granted interim relief to respondent No.1 on 03.1.2020 to the effect that no adverse orders be passed against him.

[3] The said interim relief was further extended vide order dated 04.2.2020. 2. It is the settled policy of this Court not to readily interfere in the interim orders passed by the High Court. It is desirable that the court hearing the case finally decides the same before it is brought before this court as piecemeal adjudication is not desirable.

[4] The only exception is when the interim relief granted by the High Court is arbitrary or unreasonable or reflects abuse of power or wanton exercise of discretion resulting in miscarriage of justice1. We have examined the impugned interim order and find that it does not suffer from any grave illegality or abuse of process or gross injustice.

[5] We are, therefore, not inclined to interfere in the impugned order. Accordingly, this petition is dismissed and leave refused. Islamabad, 26th January, 2023.
