[4] The contention of the learned counsel for the petitioners is that the earlier suit between the parties was a suit for» f 2 .r A look at the above order would reflect that the suit of the petitioners for partition of their property was dismissed for being barred by Rule 11 of Order VII as res-judicata and thereby their plaint was rejected.

[5] The earlier suit for which the present suit for partition has been dismissed/rejected was for a declaration under section 42 of the Specific Relief Act, 1877 and that admittedly was not decided on merits but that would not bar the subsequent suit for partition.

The suit of the petitioners would be deemed pending before the trial court who should proceed with the same from the stage where it was dismissed/rejected.
