[1] order dated 19.09.2022 of the Lahore High Court, Multan Bench passed in Crl.Misc. No. 5220 -B/2022) Gull Din. … Petitioner Versus The State through P.G., Punjab and another. … Respondent s For the Petitioner : Malik M. Usman Bhatti, ASC. For the State : Ch. Muhammad Sarwar Sidhu, Addl. Prosecutor -General, Punjab. a/w Farhat Rasool, DSP City, Muzaffargarh.

[2] Khalid Azizi, SI/IO. Respondent No. 2: Muhammad Yaqoob, ASI. Date of Hearing: 17.11.20222 . ORDER Qazi Faez Isa, J . Notice was issued to consider whether the petitioner was entitled to bail due to the fact that rule 4 (2) of the Control of Narcotic Substances (Government Analysts) Rules, 2001 (‘ the Rules ’), which provides that the seized narcotic s be dispatched for analysis ‘not later than seventy -two hours of the seizure ’, was not complied with , as the same was sent after seventeen days. 2.

[3] This Court i n a number of judgments has held that the said rule is directory, including in the case s of Tariq Mehmood v State (PLD 2009 Supreme Court 39), Gul Alam v State (2011 SCMR 624) and Muhammad Sarfraz v State (2017 SCMR 1874) . And, a five-member Bench of this Court , in the case of Tallat Ishaq v National Accountability Bureau (PLD 2019 Supreme Court 112) held that the no n-compliance of a directory rule would not entitle the petitioner to bail.

[4] Though the Tallat Ishaq was a case under the National Accountability Bureau Ordinance, 1999, i n our opinion , the Criminal Petition No. 1308 of 2022 2 stated principle enunciated therein would be equally applicable to c ases under the narcotic laws when directory provisions are not complied with. Accordingly, th e ground of non -compliance with rule 4(2) of the Rules will not on its own be a sufficient ground to entitle the petitioner to the concession of bail. 3.

[5] The learned counsel for the petitioner states that after framing of charge no progress has been made in the trial and the case is not proceeding because the prosecution side is delaying it. The learned Additional Prosecutor -General, Punjab (‘ APG’) states that as far as the prosecution is concerned it will expeditiously proceed with the case and will not seek any unnecessary adjournment.

[6] The learned counsel for the petitioner states that if the prosecution side abide s by the commitment made by the learned APG he will be satisfied and this petition may be disposed of in such terms. 4. The prosecution shall abide by the afore said commitment made by the APG and the learned Trial Judge will not entertain any unnecessary requests for adjournment from the prosecution side .

[7] With such observations this petition is disposed of . Judge Judge Judge Islamabad : 17.11.2022 (M. Tauseef) Approved for Reporting
