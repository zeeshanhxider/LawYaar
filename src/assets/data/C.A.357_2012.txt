[1] order of Mr. Muhammad Tanvir, Dy. DG. DRAP was not proper, as such the same has been withdrawn and his salaries have also been paid. The grievance of the applicant apparently seems to have been redressed. We may, however, obser ve in categorical terms that the concerned authorities of the Division which also include Directorate of Health a re not required to pressurize any of the employee s persuading them so they may not cooperate in ephedrine case which is under investigation with ANF as being an important case in its nature .

[2] ANF needs cooperation from all concerned to unearth a crime in a transparent manner as it is against this country and society. 2 Qazi Abdul Saboor, DG Health and CEO, DRAP stated that as he has given proposa l for transfer of Mr. Muhammad Tanvir from Gilgit -Baltistan to Islamabad and due to this reason he has also been transferred but uptil now no notification has been issued .

[3] He stated that the concerned authority wants to appoint a person of their own CP- etc. 3 choice against this post. We have noted the anticipated grievance of the DG but as there is still no notification on record showing his transfer, therefore, no action is required for the time being. However, in future if so happened at the cost of his cooperatio n in the investigation in the ephedrine matter, the DG may move an application which shall be decided after having taken into consideration the relevant rules on the subject.
