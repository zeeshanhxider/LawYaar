[1] judgment dated 19.02 .2014 pass ed by the Lahore High Court, Bahawalpur Bench in Crimina l Appeal No.142-J/2010/BWP and Murder Reference No.14 of 2010 ). Mansab Ali …Appellant(s) VERSUS The State …Respondent(s) For the Appellant(s) : Mr. Shahzad Hassan Sheikh , ASC (State Counsel) For the Complainant : Mr.

[2] Nasib Masih, ASC For the State : Mr. Mazhar Sher Awan, Additional Prosecutor General Date of Hearing : 10.05.2019 JUDGMENT Qazi Muhammad Amin Ahmed , J.- Rustam Ali was shot dead at 4.00 p.m. on 14.9.2008 within the remit of Police Station Mecloed Gunj. Incident was reported by his father Muhammad Bilal.

[3] Besides Mansab Ali, appellant, Muhammad Ahmad, Muhammad Mazhar, Muhammad Wahid, Muhammad Saleem, Muhammad Ismail, Muhammad Ifrahim, Muhammad Yousaf and Muhammad T ahir, differently armed were arrayed as accused in the crime report. Fatal shot is attributed to the appellant, whereas Muhammad Yousaf accused is assigned a club blow to the complainant.

[4] Motive for the crime is dispute over distribution of water . The accu sed claimed trial which resulted into appellant’s conviction under clause (b) of Section 302 of Pakistan Penal Code , 1860 with penalty of death by a learned Additional Sessions Judge vide judgment dated 17.3.2010 ; co-accused were acquitted from the charge .

[5] A learned division bench of Lahore High Court vide impugned judgment dated 19.2.2014 maintained the conviction, however altered the penalty of death into imprisonment for life . Criminal Appeal No.8 0-L of 2017 . 2 2. Prosecution case is structured upon ocular account. According to Muhamma d Bilal, PW -6, the appellant made two successive shots on the deceased , first landing on the right arm, while second hitting the back ; Muhammad Mansha, PW -7 took the same position .

[6] Both of them are in a diametrical conflict with the position taken in the c rime report wherein the appellant is assigned solitary shot landing on the deceased’s chest. Confusion is further compounded by the statement of Dr. Jav id Ahmed, PW - 3, who noted an entry wou nd on the posterior aspect of left shoulder ; the bullet exited from the chest valve; the second fire shot was on the right upper arm with its corresponding exit .

[7] This is not in line with the prosecution case that the appellant targeted the chest as the wound noted by the Medical Officer is an exit wound . Both the witness es have been duly confronted with their deviation from previous statements . From amongst the acquitted accused , Muhammad Yousaf was assigned a club blow to Muhammad Munawar, PW -8, noted by the Medical Officer as a painful swelling ; his acquittal went witho ut challenge .

[8] The learned Law Officer has not been able either to justify witnesses’ departure from previous statement s or to explain conflict between ocular account and medical evidence. Though with roles somewhat trivial nonetheless, en bloc acquittal of co-accused on the same evidence is yet another predicament facing the State .

[9] The prosecution case is fraught with doubt s, thus it would be unsafe to maintain the conviction. Resultantly, the appeal is allowed, the impugned judgment is set aside. The appel lant shall be set at liberty forthwith, if not required in any other case. JUDGE JUDGE Lahore , the 10th of May, 2019 Ghulam Raza /* JUDGE Criminal Appeal No.8 0-L of 2017 . 3
