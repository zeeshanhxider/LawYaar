[4] But later Bahria Town Scheme failed and after about half a year, the petitioner approached respondents No. 1 to 6 and demanded their money with a profit of Rs.70 lacs for every six months. The predecessor of respondents No.l to 6 namely, Talibrespondents No.7 to 9 filed a civil suit on petitioners claiming to be the legal heirs of Khizar Hussain who had an immovable property measuring 6800 sqft in Ward No. 12 Mouza Urban Tehsil and District Quetta.

Since respondent No.4 was carrying on business of real estate with the name and style of “Dosti Estate Bashira Town, Rawalpindi ” and respondent No.5 was studying in a Medical College Islamabad and both had enjoyed good relations with the petitioners being their neighbourer in Quetta.

However, it stood terminated on the death of their mother on 13.01.1999, but while -3- Civil Appeal No. 209 of2025 // agreed that the and he was admitted to bail on 07.12.2015 and during the custody the said house on 04.12.2015 which was authenticated by a Hussain, had died.Khalid Mehmood Investigating Officer allegedly tortured him and forced him to execute a contract with the petitioners in respect ofHussain had agreed to negotiate and it was property purchased by the petitioner would be purchased by respondent No.4 for a consideration of Rs. 1,60,00,000/- which would be paid in two instalments.

[7] In order to arrange the payment, the predecessor of respondents No. 1 to 6 proceeded to Islamabad. his back the respondents got registered FIR Altaf Hussain the predecessor was Collector Grade-I Quetta where he had to execute mutation No.926 of the subject house in the name of the petitioners and then on 16.05.2015 the predecessor of respondents No.4 85 5 was acquitted by the Magistrate Quetta under section 249-A Cr.P.C.

[8] The petitioner, meanwhile, issued a notice to the Election Commission of Pakistan, Balochistan to deposit the rent in the account of Muhammad Jamshed. Because of this episode, unfortunately AltafNotary Public. During police custody, the female family members were also compelled to produce the power of attorney and then brought before the AssistantHowever, on No., dated 14.11.2015, under section 406, 417, 419, 420, 424, 109, 465, 468, 471, 34, 504, 506 PPC at police station Industrial Area, Quetta against Talib Hussain and respondents No.4 85 5.

[9] The predecessor of respondents No.l to 6; Altaf Hussain was arrested on 02.12.2015 in Islamabad and brought to Quetta -4- Civil Appeal No. 209 of2025 I.After hearing the learned counsel for the petitioner and 3. admittedly, Altaf Hussain, the predecessor of respondents No.l to 6 remained in police custody in FIR No.  (supra) from 02.12.0215 to 07.12.2015 and during this period an agreement was got signed on 04.12.2015.

[10] It has been so admitted in written reply submitted by the petitioner in the suit filed by the respondents. Besides, Arshad Khan (DW-5) identified the thumb impression on the agreement (Exh.D-4) who had also admitted that the Iqrarnama was executed after Juma prayer which means that brought before the said Magistrate.

[11] Even otherwise, the petitioners transitory remand by the Judicial Magistrate Islamabad to Quetta for 02 days and then the production of Altaf Hussain to the Magistrate on 04.12.2015, before the grant of post arrest bail on 07.12.2015. Under the law a transaction or an agreement executed under 4. custody or detention could potentially be considered as having been made under coercion, duress or undue influence, if the free consent is not given or the expressed will was the outcome of such circumstances. i particularly vulnerable to coercion or duress as his freedom or liability to resist is severely limited.

[13] It does not necessarily imply that the means used should be in themselves unlawful, but includes the use of lawfulI. t. t imeans in an unlawful improper purpose. A duress by imprisonment, both lawful or unlawful, to force the party into executing a contract is illegal.duress are manner or for anor consensus ad idem).

[15] While coercion is an act of enforcing a will but the undue influence or the consequence of coercion. A contract procured under duress by one party over the other is void and any benefit received therefrom must be restored and the losscoercion, undue influence, fraud, misrepresentation or mistake, the consent is not free.3 An undue a demonstration of controlling the will of the party because of the prevailing situation of the -6- Civil Appeal No. 209 of2025 consent as defined under section 13 of the said Act and free consent under section 14 of the Act ibid.

[16] The complainant of the FIR was obviously in a position to dominate the will of accused Altaf Hussain and therefore, the burden lied upon the petitioner to predecessor or respondents No.4 8s 5 have received any single predecessor of respondents No. 1 to 6; Altaf Hussain was the co- 13.01.1999 which terminated the agency {Exh.P-3).

[17] Obviously, the transaction so made were based on the agreement which was void therefore the learned High Court had declared the agreement dated cancelled and mutation No.428 was restored. We have not been able to find ourselves in agreement to the 7. learned counsel for the petitioner that after the release of Altaf Hussain the mutation was sanctioned and that it took one year to challenge the said mutation which ought to have been challenged immediately after the transaction.

[18] However, with the said argument since the suit was filed within time and the made was without any duress and was made with free consent. We question extensively and had rightly held that the transaction made consequent to the agreement in police custody was void.have not beep able to find such evidence to support the case of the petitioner and that is the reason that the High Court has dealt thewe are not impressed petitioner was under heavy burden to prove that the transaction soowner of the house and that executant Salma Sultana had died onbargain/deal.

Theprove that he had not exerted any influence ( Civil Appeal No. 209 of2025 -7- 8. For the foregoing reasons, we do not find any ground to interfere into the findings given by the High Court and dismiss this civil appeal.
