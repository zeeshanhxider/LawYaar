No.955 -L/2016) For the State: Mirza Abid Majeed, Deputy Prosecutor General Punjab Date of hearing: 3.12.2019 JUDGMENT Qazi Muhammad Amin Ahmed, J. - Safdar Abbas and Akhtar Abbas, petitioners, real brothers inter se , are in receipt of a guilty verdict, returned by a learned Additional Sessions Judge at Jhang vide judgment dated 23.12.2011 ; they were tried , through a private complaint, alongside four others for committing Qatl-i-Amd of Muhammad Bukhsh on 5.4.2008 within the precincts of Police Station 18-Hazarvi District Jhang in the backdrop of a motive relating to divergent claim s on a piece of agricultural land ; one of the accused, namely, Mubeen Saghar is still away from law under a perpetual warrant of arrest; the co -accused were acquitted from the charge while the petitioners stand convicted under clause (b) of section 302 read with section 34 of the Pakistan Penal Code, 1860 ; they were sentenced Cr.P.

[3] No.955 -L/2016, Cr. P. 973 -L/2016 2 to death, altered into imprisonment for life by a learned Division Bench of Lahore High Court Lahore vide impugned judgment dated 24.06.2016, vires whereof are being assailed , primarily , on the ground that evidence disbelieved qua majority of the accused, eac h identically placed, cannot be pressed into service , in the absence of independent corroboration, to sustain the charge vis-à-vis the petitioners , a position vehemently contested on behalf of the complainant. 2.

[4] Heard. Record perused. 3. Petitioners’ father, namely, Charagh co -accused is assigned multiple club blows to Muhammad Bukhsh deceased; same is charge against Muzaffar co -accused; remainder of the accused, though assigned no harm to the deceased, nonetheless, are ascribed effective roles to the PWs ; they are closely related being member s of the same clan and in the totality of circumstances given the accusation, their roles cannot be bifurcated without nullifying the entire case .

[5] Motive cited in the crime report is non -specific ; inve stigative conclusions were inconsistent with the case set up by the complainant . Recoveries are inconsequential. Complainant abandoned his case against the acquitted co-accused after failure of his petition seeking leave to appeal in the High Court .

[6] In thi s backdrop, no intelligible or objective distinction can be drawn to hold the petitioners guilty of the charge in isolation with their co -accused. Prosecution evidence, substantially found flawed , it would be unsafe to maintain the conviction without potential risk of error . Criminal Petition No.955 -L/2016 is converted into appeal and allowed, impugned judgment is set aside, the petitioner s/appellant s shall be released forthwith, if not required to be detained in any other case.

[7] As a natural corollary, complainant petition seeking enhancement is dismissed. Judge Judge Judge Islamabad 3rd December , 2019 Not approved for reporting Azmat *
