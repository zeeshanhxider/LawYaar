[1] judgment dated 14.12.2011 passed by the Peshawar High Court, Peshawar in Ehtesab Criminal Appeal No.15 of 2003) . Abdullah Jan …Appellant(s) VERSUS The State & others …Respondent(s) For the Appellant(s) : Syed Zafar Abbas Zaidi, ASC Haji Muhammad Zahir Shah, AOR For The Nationa l Accountability Bureau : Syed Azeem Dad, Additional Deputy Prosecutor General, National Accountability Bureau Date of Hearing : 30.04.2019 ORDER Qazi Muhammad Amin Ahmed , J.- Abdullah Jan, appellant herein , is in receipt of a guilty verdict returned by learned Judge, Accountability Court No.1, Peshawar vide impugned judgment dated 13.9.2013 .

[2] As a Store Keeper in Communication & Works Department , he was found to have accumulated assets , hugely disproportionate to his legitimate source of income . Feeling aggrieved, the appel lant questioned vires of his conviction before the Peshawar High Court ; the attempt met with no better fate as the learned High Court concurred with the findings recorded by the learned trial Court vide judgment dated 14.12.2011 . 2.

[3] We have noticed that the learned High Court while affirming findings rendered by the learned Accountability Court has not discussed evidence adduced by the prosecution as well as the appellant and thus we feel handicapped to objectively verify the points of determination as well as contentions raised by the appellant and therefore consider it in the fitness of things to remit Criminal Appeal No .19-P/2014 2 this matter to the learned High Court so as to benefit us with detailed discussion within the contemplation of Section 367 of t he Code of Criminal Procedure, 1898 .

[4] This appeal is allowed, t he impugned judgment is set aside , the case is remanded and shall be deemed to be pending for decision afresh. It is expected that the learned High Court would find it convenient, in the fullnes s of time, sooner rather than later, to decide the issue , after affording opportunity of hearing to the appellant .
