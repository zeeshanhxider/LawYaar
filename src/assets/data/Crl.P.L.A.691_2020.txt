[1] judgment dated 3.4.2020 of the Peshawar High Court, Peshawar passed in Cr.MBA No.446 -P of 2020) Shehryar Khan .…Petitioner(s) Versus The State and another ….Respondent (s) For the Petitioner(s): Mr. Asad Ullah Khan Chamkani , ASC For the State: Mr. Anis M. Shahzad, ASC Gul Wali , Inspector/ I.O. For the Complainant: Mr.

[2] Riazat ul Haq, ASC Date of hearing: 03.08.2020. ORDER Qazi Muhammad Amin Ahmed , J.- Shehryar Khan, petitioner, attributed a fatal shot to Sabir -ur-Rehman, deceased, in his mid 60s, at 9:30 a.m. on 13.04.2019, within the remit of Police Station Daduzai Peshawar, in the backdrop of a dispute over immovable property, seeks admission to bail , primarily on the strength of a ‘ cross version ’ structured upon a fire arm injury , sustained by Majid Khan, co -accused, no other than his real brother , medically examined under a police docket on the fateful day .

[3] Petitioner, after the incident, stayed away from law and was, accordingly , proceeded under Section 512 of the Code of Criminal Procedure 1898 ; he was finall y taken into custody on 12.02.2020 . 2. Heard. Record perused. 3. It would be less than expedient to comment upon the merits of the prosecution case, bracing a cross version set up on an injury , sustained by the co -accused, pressed into service with vehemence to construct hypothesis of self defence, a controversy to be best settled by the Criminal Petition No.691 of 2020 2 trial Court.

[4] Argument regarding suppression of injury sustained by Majid, co-accused, in the face of identica l suppression in the cross version regarding the fatal shot on to the deceased , does not bring petitioner’s case at a higher pedestal so as to be received with favour. Saddled with the responsibility of the fatal shot, petitioner’s absence from law , additi onally, stands in impediment to his release on bail.

[5] Given the role attributed to the petitioner, e xistence of a cross version , veracity whereof is yet to be settled , by itself would not bring his case within the purview of further probe. Petition fails. L eave declined. Judge Judge Islamabad, the 3rd August, 2020 Not approved for reporting Ghulam Raza /-
