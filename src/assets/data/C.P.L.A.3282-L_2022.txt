[16] Our order dated 02.02.2023 summarises the petitio ner’s challenge to the impugned interim orders in the following terms: “Learned counsel for the petitioner submits that recovery of tax under Section 4C of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 ( "Ordinance ") has been challenged by the respondents through writ pet itions filed before the High Court.

[17] The High Court has passed interim orders restraining recovery of the tax against the security of the post -dated cheques. She submits that in the first place the respondents have not challenged the vires of Section 4C ibi d. For bypassing statutory remedies and failing jurisdictional tests for maintainability, these petitions cannot proceed before the High Court.

[18] In case the petitioner's challenge is construed to be an attack on the vires of the law, the impugned stay order by the High Court is without jurisdiction for suspending a statute as laid down by this Court in Federation of Pakistan Vs. Aitzaz Ahsan and another (PLD 1989 SC 61). In any event, a crucial aspect for the grant of interim relief, namely, balance of conve nience ought to have been examined by the learned High Court but that factor has been completely overlooked whilst granting the interim relief on terms that have choked crucial revenue for the Exchequer. 2.

[19] We note that the impugned orders dated 28.9.2022 and 29.9.2022 do not consider the points r aised before us. Also that post -dated cheques are mere solace; providing neither tangible security nor adequate comfort. We would like to examine the points urged by the learned counsel for the petitioner. ” 2.

[20] Today, we have heard the learned counsel for the parties. A consensus has emerged among the parties that the controversy regarding the matter should in the first place be C.P.3282 -L/22 etc 5 decided final ly by the High Court. With respect to the grant of interim relief, there i s also consensus that the challenge made by the respondents is to the vires of law and that the operation of Subsection 3 & 4 of Section 4C of the Ordinance have virtually been suspended on account of the impugned interim orders that are presently assailed before us.

[21] It is also plain that whilst considering the grant of interim relief, the High Court has failed to advert its mind to the crucia l factor of the balance of convenience. In view of the above, the respondents have consented to deposit under protes t with the tax authorities 50% of the liability claimed against them under the impugned provision s of Ordinance.

[22] However, the amount of such deposit shall be reduced by the amount of a ny refund that has been determined by the tax authorities in favour of t he respondents . Needful to be done within one week from the date of this order . 2. With the foregoing observations, these matters are disposed of.
