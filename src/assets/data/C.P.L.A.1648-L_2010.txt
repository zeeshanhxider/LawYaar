[2] Nadeem -ud-Din Malik, ASC. Mr. Khushi Muhammad Nazir, Manager (Properties). Date of hearing : 15.10.2015. JUDGMENT UMAR ATA BANDIAL, J. – The judgment dated 26.04.2010 rendered by a learne d Division Bench of the Lahore High Court, Lahore is assailed in this petition. The impugned judgment affirmed the view taken by the learned Single Judge of the High Court, who in exercise of his jurisdiction as Cooperative Judge dismissed on 28.04.2003 the petitioners’ application filed against the order dated 28.04.2001 passed by the Chairman, Punjab Cooperative Board for Liquidation (“PCBL”) .

[3] By this order the Chairman, PCBL cancelled the “No Objection Certificate (“NOC”) ” dated 30.10.1997 issued by his predecessor for sale to the petitioners of land measuring 193 Kanals 12 CP.1648 -L of 2010 2 Marlas situated in village Maraka, Tehsil & District Lahore belonging to National Industrial Cooperative Finance Corporation (“NICFC”) in exchange for cash deposit receipts (“CDRs”) issued by the NICFC and National Industrial Cooperative Credit Corporation (“NICCC”) , both being defunct undesirable cooperative corporations (“CFCs”) . 2.

[4] Learned counsel for the petitioners submits that the concurrent findings given by the High Court and the Chairman, PCBL are barred by locus poenitentiae . The said transaction of sale in favour of the petitioners was concluded under two agreements to sell executed on 28.10.1991 and 05.11.1991 by Ch. Abdul Majeed, Chairman of the both NICFC and NICCC .

[5] Out of total sale consideration of Rs.25.268 million, an amount of Rs.25.093 million already stood adjust ed against CDRs for funds held by the petitioners before this Court in the accounts of the two defunct CFCs , with the balance amount of Rs.74,229/ - being p ayable in cash on execution of the sale deed.

[6] On 30.10.1997 the Chairman, PCBL gave his NOC to the sale in favour of the petitioners and on 26.06.1999 he gave permission to execute sale deed in their favour. The petitioners state that the sale consideratio n under the agreements to sell exceeds the value for the land transacted and the cancellation of NOC dated 30.10.1997 by the Chairman, PCBL on 28.04.2001 , as affirmed by the High Court, violate s the vested rights of the petitioners. 3.

[7] We have heard the learned counsel for the parties and have carefully scanned the record of the case. The following features in this case may be noted before discussin g the plea taken by the learned CP.1648 -L of 2010 4 to show that the said Chairman has authority under the charter of the said CFCs to unilaterally or single handedly sell the immovable property of the NICFC .

[8] Co nsequently, the impugned judgments and the impugned order have consider ed the underlying agreement s to sell to be collusive. This is concluded also for the reason that at least 23 unconnected persons holding CDRs in the two CFCs have , without being members of a family or a legal entity or having any other mutual link, combined to purchase immovable property from NICFC .

[9] This is done without even fixing their individual shares in the property agreed to be purchased , indicat ing the presence of benami interests . The enterprise undertaken by the petitioners ostensibly seeks pre-emptive recovery of their blocked funds in the two defunct CFCs by the acquisition of an asset having readily realizable value .

[10] By this means , they purport to secure priority and advantage over other similarly placed depositors/creditors of the two defunct CFCs . 4. The provisions of the PUCS Act, 1993 and its preceding legislation appoint PCBL as liquidator of defunct CFCs. The liquidation of these CFCs is ordained by the said law on acco unt of their illegal activities , heavy indebt edness to the public and consequent insolvency.

[11] It is a settled principle of law that a liquidator/receiver of an insolvent entity is vested with the power to avoid voluntary transfers made by the insolvent . Lik ewise, a liquidator /receiver has the power to avoid transactions that may be deemed to constitute fraudulent preferences. These powers are codified , inter alia , in Section 53 and 54 of the Provincial Insolvency Act, 1920 .

[12] The principles of law CP.1648 -L of 2010 6 to any lawful scheme notified by the PCBL or the Provincial Government under the PUCS Act , 1993 for settlement or adjustment of claims by depositors. Otherwise the settled principle of law for distribution of assets among the same class of creditors of an insolvent is done ‘pro rata ’ through proportionate abatement of claims as envisaged in Section 61 of the Provincial Insolvency Act, 1920.

[13] By this method, all the creditors of equal standing , in the present case, the CDR holders of a defunct CFC are put to equal risk/loss in case of non - realization of their respective debts in entirety . 5. The foregoing approach is noticeable in the impugned order dated 28.04.2 001 passed by the Chairman, PCBL, which mentions the provisions of clauses (b) and (e) of Section 7 of the PUCS Act, 1993.

[14] Quite apart from the said valid grounds adopted by the impugned decisions , to our minds, the general powers of a liquidator/receiver, namely, to avoid voluntary transfer s and make pro rata distribution meant to treat similarly placed creditors of an insolvent entity equally are encapsulated in the provisions of Section 7 of the PUCS Act, 1993.

[15] Accordingly, the preference given to the petitioners o ver other similarly placed creditors of the two defunct CFCs defeats any claim of locus poenitentiae posited by the petitioners. The said reason therefore suffices to cancel the NOC issued in favour of the petitioners . Consequently, the impugned judgment s of the High Court and the impugned order of the Chairman, PCBL are lawful and valid.

[16] CP.1648 -L of 2010 7 For the foregoing reasons, we do not find any merit in this petition, which is accordingly dismissed alongwith all ancillary Misc. Application s. Leave to app eal is refused. CJ. J. J. Islamabad , 15.10.2015. Irshad Hussain /* APPROVED FOR REPORTING.
