[1] ORDER Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, CJ. â€” For reasons to be record ed later it is held that petitioner , Dr. Muhammad Tahir -ul-Qadri has failed to make out a case for exercising the discretionary jurisdiction by this Court under Article 1 84(3) of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan , for the fact s that violation of any of the Fundamental Rights under Chapter 1 of Part II of the Constitution has neither been listed in the petition nor established during course of arguments , despite of insistence by the Bench to do so .

[2] The petitioner has also failed to prove his bona fides in view of the facts , which have Constitution.P. 2 been noticed at the hearing of the case , to invoke the jurisdiction of this Court coupled with the fact that under the peculiar circumstances he has no locus standi to claim relief as it has been prayed for in the petition, inter alia, for the reasons that being a holder of dual citizenship , he is not qualified ( disqualified ) to contest the election to the Parliament in view of the constitutional bar under Article 63(1)(c) of the Constitution, which has been interpreted by this Court in the case of Syed Mehmood Akhtar Naqvi v.

However, it is loudly and clearly observed that as a voter like other overseas Pakistanis , whose names have been incorporated in the Electoral Rolls, he can exer cise his right of vote as this right is recognized under the Constitution and has also been held by this Court in the case of Yasmin Khan v.

[4] Electi on Commission of Pakistan (1994 SCMR 113), which was finally disposed of vide judgment in Constitution Petition  dated 18.12.1993 . Thus, the petition is dismissed. 3. Before parting with th e short order, it is essential to note that at the time o f concluding his arguments on the points noted hereinabove , he started making uncalled for aspersions against the member of the Bench , which are tantamount prima facie to undermin e its authority calling for action against him for Contempt of Court under Article 204(3) of the Constit ution read with section 3 of the Contempt of Court Ordinance, 2003 .

[5] However we, while exercising restraint , have decided not to proceed against him following the principle that such jurisdiction has to be exercised sparingly on c ase to case basis. Chief Justice Judge Judge Islamabad, the 13th February, 2013
