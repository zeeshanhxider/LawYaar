[1] ORDER The Human Rights Cell of this Court has placed a note before the Court, which postulat es that all the schools in the Cantonment areas across Pakistan are being d irected to be shifted from the C antonment areas within a period of 15 days. Although vide order dated 24.10.2017, passed by a two Member Bench of this Court in Civil Appeal No. , it has been directed that the exercise of removing educational and comm ercial buildings etc., from the concerned areas be made gradually , yet from the note put up before us, it seems that the said order has not been complied with in letter and spirit and thus, the educational career of a substantial number of students would b e at stake if immediate action of removal of the said school is allowed. 2.

[2] In the light of the above, we issue notice to all the Cantonment Boards in Pakistan to submit their replies about the question as to why action has been taken in such haste and what was the urgency therein . Till the next order to the contrary , the order of this Court dated 24.10.2017 is held in abeyance , meaning thereby that no school shall be vacate d/transferred from the Cantonment areas till such order is passed by this Court.
