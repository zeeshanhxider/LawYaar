[1] ORDER The impugned judgment of the Election Commission of Pakistan (“ECP” ) dated 08.03.2021, which was preceded by a short order dated 25.02.2021, has been read to the Court. The relevant facts of the present lis are that on 20.02.2021, a day after the polling in the by e-election of NA -75, Sialkot -IV had concluded , respondent No. 1 (a contesting candidate) complained Civil Appeal No.166 of 2021 2 to the Returning Officer and the E CP about irregularities committed at twenty polling stations .

[2] Thereafter, o n completion of his preliminary inquiry , the Returning Officer vide report dated 21.02.2021 accepted the claim of respondent No. 1 only to the extent of fourteen polling stations. However, after hearing the parties, ECP in its impugned short order dated 25.02.2021 declared the whole election of NA -75, Sialkot -IV null and void. 2.

[3] It is accepted by all sides appearing in the matter that t wo persons were killed at one polling station , roughly forty polling stations were affected by aerial firing and Presiding Officer s of twenty polling station s went missing because of which they could n ot hand over the result s to the Returning Officer in time.

[4] More importantly , the underlying tenor of the impugned judgment is that the police were silent spectators who did not intervene to check the acts of intimidation, harassment and violence that took place outside the polling stations on election day. In fact, the impugned judgment has observed that neither the Inspector General of Police , Punjab nor the Chief Secretary , Punjab responded to the ECP’s request on polling day for controlling the law and order situation in Daska .

[5] Instead, only the Federal Government r eacted by providing protection throug h Rangers for the polling staff, polling stations and polling material. 3. There is no cavil with the proposition that ECP is empowered under Article 218(3) of the Constitution read with Section 9 of the Elections Act, 2017 (“Act” ) to ensure that electio ns are conducted honest ly, just ly, fair ly and lawfully in such a manner that coercion, intimidation and pressure tactics Civil Appeal No.166 of 2021 3 are stymied .

[6] However, t he question before us is: what standard of proof, quantum of evidence , scale and severity of violation s of law will warrant a re-poll in the entire constituency. As it presently stands, Section 9 ibid operates in a very limited span of sixty days following the publication of the result of an election.

[7] The jurisdiction of ECP under the said provision partakes of exec utive and quasi -judicial powers that may be exercised promptly to cure any irregularity in the conduct of an election . Therefore, the benchmarks laid down by the law for the Election Tribunal to annul an election and order a re -poll may not strictly apply to the ECP under the said Section without suitable modification .

[8] In such circumstances w e would like to examine whether the impugned action of the ECP , namely, its allegedly excessive response to the prevailing situation in Daska was within its jurisdictio nal parameters . The learned counsel for the parties have so far not analyzed the extensive material on record to relate the same to the powers and jurisdiction of the ECP under the Constitution and the Act.

[9] In particular, the following questions have not b een addressed: a. What transgressions on the polling day could constitute grave illegalities or violations calling for a fresh rather than a partial re -poll? b. In what situations would non -pervasiveness of the illegalities or violations committed on polling day still attract the same result? 4.

[10] To assist the Court in answering these questions , we would appreciate if ECP could present a map of the constituency labelling the polling stations where specified wrongs were Civil Appeal No.166 of 2021 4 committed along with a chart explaining the said labels . To come up for arguments on the foregoing points on 19.03.2021 .
