[1] judgment dated 08.11.2017 passed by the High C ourt of Balochistan, Quetta in Constitution Petition No.721 of 2015.) Jahanzaib Malik … Petitioner VERSUS Balochistan Public Procurement Regulatory Authority, through its Chairman Board of Directors and others … Respondent s For the petitioner : Mr. Tariq Mehmood, Sr.

[2] ASC. For respondent s No.1&2: Mr. Ayaz Swati, Addl. A.G. For respondent No.3: N.R. (Not represented ) Date of hearing: 04.01.2018 ORDER IJAZ UL AHSAN , J. – The petitioner seeks leave to appeal against a judgment o f the Division Bench of the High Court of Balochistan dated 08.11.2017. Th rough the impugned judgment, Constitutional Petition No.721 of 2015 filed by Respondent No.3 was partly allowed and the order dated 08.04.2015 and notification dated 29.08.2017 issue d by Respondent Nos. 1 and 2 were set aside. 2.

[3] The brief facts of the case are that Respondent No.3 Balochistan Public Procurement Regulatory Authority (“BPPRA”) invited application s for appointment against a post of Director C.P.No.216 -Q/2017. 2 (Monitoring and Evaluation). The qualification for the said post as advertised, was Master s Degree in Social Sciences and 5 years experience in the relevant fi eld.

[4] The last date for submission of application s was 28.08.2014. The petitioner and Respondent No.3 applied for the said post. After a test conducted by NTS and interview s taken by a Committee of senior officers , respondent No.3 was appointed against the said post through a contract dated 08.04.2015 , for a period of 2 years.

[5] On expiry of the said 2 years period , during pendency of Constitutional Petition before the High Court , the petitioner was granted extension for another period of 2 years from 08.04.201 7 to 08.04.2019. 3. Respondent No.3 who was also one of the applicants was not appointed . He challenged the appointment of the petitioner before the High Court on the ground that he neither possess ed the requisite qualification nor experience in the relevant fi eld on the last date for submission of application s i.e. 28.08.2014.

[6] Therefore he was not lawfully appointed. The lea rned High Court came to the conclusion that the petitioner did not possess the requisite educational qualification when he was appointed against the said post. Further , his appointment could not validly be extended in view of the fact that the extension no tification was issued in continuation of the earlier notification . on the basis of which the petitioner had been appointed.

[7] Despite the fact that Respondent No.3 did not challenge the extension notification either by way of amendment or through a fresh con stitution petition, the High C.P.No.216 -Q/2017. 3 Court proceeded to take notice of such development and set aside the extension order also. Hence this petition. 4. The learned counsel for the petitioner submits that the qualification for appointment to the post of Director ( Monitoring and Evaluation) was a Masters Degree in Social Sciences or equivalent and 5 years experience in the relevant field.

[8] He submits that the petitioner possesses a degree of Masters of Science in Electronic Business Management from the University of Warwick, UK. It is recognized by the Higher Education Commission of Pakistan as equivalent to corresponding Master s of Science Degree involving 16 years of schooling in the relevant field from Pakistan.

[9] He further submits that the petitioner also had a Mas ters degree in Business Administration (MBA) from the Institute of Business Administration (IBA), Karachi. He had completed the course work in 2014 , however the actual degree was issued on 7th of March, 2015 which was before the employment contract dated 0 8.04.2015 was issued in his favour .

[10] That being the case , the High Court erred in fact in coming to the conclusion that the petitioner was not qualified on the date of his appointment. He further submits that the contract of the petitioner was validly exten ded w ith effect f rom 08.04.2017 by the Competent Authority as per applicable rules on the basis of recommendations made by a Selection Committee , considering very good performance evaluation reports earned by the petitioner from 2015 to 2017. 5.

[11] Notice h ad been issued to Respondent No.3. Despite service he has not entered appearance. He is therefore, proceeded C.P.No.216 -Q/2017. 4 against ex-parte. The learned Additional Advocate General, Balochistan has supported the arguments advanced by the learned counsel for petitioner. 6. We have heard the learned counsel for the petitioner and carefully examined the record.

[12] The petitioner had applied for the post of Director (Monitoring and Evaluation) in BPPRA. The last date for submission of application s was 28.08.2014. At the time when the petitioner filed his application, he mentioned his qualification as holding a Masters Degree in Electronic Business Management from the University of Warwick, UK and an MBA degree from Institute of Business Administration, Karachi .

[13] The year of comp letion of degree was mentioned as 2014. 7. There is no denial of the fact that the petitioner was at the top of the list on the basis of his performance in the test and interview. Further, he was selected on the basis of his MBA degree. The documents exam ined by us also indicate that the petitioner has completed his degree in January, 2014 with an cumulative Grade Point Average (“ GPA”) of 3.19.

[14] However, the degree was formally issued on 7th of March, 2015 for reasons beyond the control of the petitioner. T he degree itself shows that the petitioner had successfully completed the requisite course work and examination in the academic year 2014. The transcript issued by the Institute of Business Administration, Karachi also verifies the fact that the petitioner had completed his degree in January, 2014.

[15] That being the case, Respondent s No.1 and 2 were justified in C.P.No.216 -Q/2017. 5 considering the petitioner as duly qualified on the basis of his MBA degree from IBA. 8. The fact that the degree was formally issued in year 2015 is not, in the facts and circumstances of the present case of much significance .

[16] The degree itself shows that the petitioner had successfully completed the requisite course work and examination in the academic year 2014 . This is further substantiated by the Transcript of C redit issued by the Institute of Business Administration, Karachi which shows that the petitioner had completed his degree in January, 2014 with an cumulative GPA of 3.19. 9.

[17] In addition, we notice that the 2 years contract of the petitione r expired on 08.04.2015 . In consequence of which the Constitutional Petition as originally filed was rendered infructuou s. The petitioner was granted a further extension of 2 years vide office order dated 29th August, 2017 w ith effect from 08.04.2017.

[18] The said office order was not challenged by Respondent No.3 either through amendment in the Constitutional Petition or by filing a fresh petition. By taking Suo Moto Notice of such extension, the High Court appears to have exceeded its jurisdiction for reasons which are not legally sustainable. In addition, through the office order dated 29th August, 2017 , six other officials of Balochistan Public Procurement Regulatory Authority had been granted two years extension of service .

[19] Such employees were neither befor e the High Court nor were their appointments or reappointment orders under challenge. Yet without hearing the said persons or C.P.No.216 -Q/2017. 6 considering their cases , the High Court proceeded to set aside their extensions also , by setting aside office order dated 29.08.20 17.

[20] This is an additional ground for our inability to uphold the judgment of the High Court. 10. It may be pointed out that the only reason assigned by the High Court for setting aside the extension order dated 29th August, 2017 is that it is in continuat ion of the original appointment order which had been set aside.

[21] We have already held that the original appointment order was validly issued . The refore the reasons recorded by the High Court for setting aside the extension order automatically pale into in significance. 11. For reasons recorded above, we convert this petition into an appeal and allow the same. The impugned judgment of the High Court is accordingly set aside.
