[2] Director FIA, M. Salman Deputy Director FIA Maqsood Ahmed, Forensic Officer, Humaira Aslam SI, FIA For the Complainant: Mr. M. Junaid Akhtar, ASC Date of hearing: 16.04.2020. ORDE R Qazi Muhammad Amin Ahmed, J .- Behind bars since 01.01.2020 , Dr. Atif Mehmood Khan, petitioner, seeks admission to bail; member of academia , he is blamed by his former wife Ms.

[3] Fozia Anwar for disseminating her explicit photographs through a Whats App profile , transmitted from a cell phone number issued by a United Kingdome Service Provider ; the pictures accompanied threatening/ abusive messages , circulated among the family members with an obvious motive to humiliate and embarrass the lady.

[4] During investigation, petitioner led to the recovery of a number of articles, secured vide inventory dated 02.01.2020 that included a mobile phone handset along with four SIMs (Subscriber Identity Modules) as well as a Criminal Petition No. 277 of 2020 2 memory card with different IMEI number s, dispatched to National Response Center for Cyber Crimes (NR3C), Federation Investigation Agency Islamabad for digital forensic examination.

[5] As per report dated 31.02.2020 , paraphernalia recovered during the investigation did not indicate to have g enerated the impugned material , on the basis whereof, the Investigating Officer , vide case diary No.10 dated 12.2.2020 , exonerate d the petitioner and accordingly placed him in Column 2 of the report under Section 173 of the Code of Criminal Procedure 1898 . 2.

[6] Heard. Record perused. 3. Bad blood between the erstwhile spouses though a possible motive to target the complainant, nonetheless, requires independent evidence to prima facie frame the petitioner with the charge ; forensic evidence, the only tool to sustain the charge, for the present , is faltering as the findings recorded by the Federal Investigation Agency are in the negative .

[7] Ch. Aamir -ur-Rehman, learned Additional Attorney General for Pakistan has very fairly conceded the point . Argument by the learned counsel for the complainant that the petitioner alone had an axe to grind, a circumstance by itself sufficient to drive home the charge , is beside the mark . Petitioner ’s culpability, after prosecution’ s failure on forensic side, can best be settled after recording of evidence and, thus, his incarceration till conclusion thereof , would be inexpedient .

[8] A case for grant of bail stands made out. Criminal Petition is converted into appeal and allowed; the petitioner shall be released on bail upon furnishing a bond in the sum of Rs.500,000/ - with one surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of the learned trial Court /Duty Magistrate .
