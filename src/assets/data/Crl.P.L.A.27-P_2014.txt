No.  1) Gul Zarin and other …Petitioner Versus Fazal Khaliq and another ..Respondent For the Petitioner(s) : Haji Muhammad Zahir Shah, ASC For the Respondent (s): N.R. For the State : Mr. Muhammad Nisar, Addl. Advocat e General KPK Date of hearing: 06.7.2021 ORDER Qazi Muhammad Amin Ahmed , J-.

[2] Respondent was tried for murderous assault as well as on two counts of homicide by a learned Additional Sessions Judge at Wari , District Dir Upper ; convicted on all counts , he was sentenced to imprisonment for life and ten years rigorous imprisonment respectively vide judgment dated 10.10.2011 , overturned by a Division Bench of Peshawar High Court, Mingora Bench vide impugned judgment dated 03.05.2014 , vires whereof, are bein g assailed on the ground s that in the face of overwhelming evidence comprising of witnesses that included an injured to support a dying declaration , there was no occasion for the High Court to acquit the respondent , blamed alongside the absconding co -accus ed for the crime in the backdrop of a motive over immovable property , resulting into the loss of two lives ; he has referred to respondent’s return after absconsion, spreading over a quarter of a century with his accomplices still away from law , to finally earn acquittal .

[3] The learned counsel has further argued that non-performance of autopsy on the dead , being a practice in line with Cr.P. 27-P/2014 2 local c ustom did not adversely reflect upon the prosecution case inasmuch as the homicidal death s of both the deceased remaine d a common ground throughout ; according to him, the impugned view being based upon reasons, artificial and illusory, is untenable at law and, thus, tends to result into miscarriage of justice , clamouring interference by this Court .

[4] Though much water has flown under the bridge, nonetheless, the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case , despite flux of time, call for reappraisal of prosecution’s evidence to secure the ends of justice. Leave is granted , inter alia , to consider the above contentions . Send for the respondent through bailable warrant in the sum of Rs.200,000/ - with one surety in the like amount, returnable to the Assistant Registrar of this Court at Peshawar , to be executed through the Station House Officer , within a fortnight .
