[1] ORDER Mr. Muhammad Safdar, Project Director (Machine Readable Passport s), Immigration & Passport Department submits that the office is in receipt of the applications of 7500 overseas Pakistanis who are held up in China because of non -availability of Machine Readabl e Passports in Pakistan Embassy in China.

[2] He added that the machine was installed in February, 2013 , however, it is not operational on account of non -appointment of the technical officer which is a grade -17 post. Adds on Court query that a reference was se nt to Ministry of Interior in July, 2013; that  reminders were issued but the Ministry has not issued the requisite appointment order because the said Ministry has sent the reference to the Prime Minister Secretariat and on account of the general ban im posed, no further action could be taken. 2.

[3] We are surprised and rather dismayed over the insensitive attitude of the passport department. However, before we pass any order, we are persuaded to direct Secretary Interior to appear in Court on 19. 02.2014 and explain the factual position.
