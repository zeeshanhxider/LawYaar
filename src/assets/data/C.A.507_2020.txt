[1] judgment dated 30.08.2019 passed by the Balochista n Service Tribunal, Quetta in S ervice Appeal No.611 of 2018). Chief Secretary, Government of Balochistan, Quetta and others. …Appellant (s) Versus Asmatullah Kakar. …Respondent(s) For the Appellant (s): Mr. Arbab Muhammad Tahir, A. G. Baloc histan . (via video link from Quetta) Mr.

[2] Ayaz Khan Swati, Addl. A. G. Balochistan (from Islamabad) For the Respondent (s): Mr. M. Akram Shah, ASC . (via video link from Quetta) (appear ed without filing of enter appearance) Date of Hearing: 18.08.2020. JUDGMENT IJAZ UL AHSAN , J.- The Appellants challenged the judgment of the Balochistan Service Tribunal, Quetta dated 30.08.2019.

[3] Through the impugned judgment , a notification dated 18.10.2018 and letter dated 12.12.2018 issued by the Secretary S&G AD, Government of Balochistan to the extent of retirement of the Respondent was set aside with the result that date of birth of the Respondent was accepted as 25.12.1961 instead of 08.01.1959 .

[4] The later date was recorded in the relevant service record s of Respondent . CIVIL APPEALS NO.507 & 604 OF 2020. 2 2. Briefly stated the facts of the case are that the Respondent claimed that he was born on 25.12.1961 in Kuchlak District, Quetta. However, at the time of joining service, his date of birth was mentioned as 08.01.1959.

[5] He claimed that his d ate of birth was not correctly mentioned in his service record. Therefore, in order to insert his correct date of birth in his service and other relevant records he filed an application with department. On the refusal of the department to do so, he filed a suit of declaration and permanent injunction before the Civil Court .

[6] In the said suit, he impleaded Chairman, Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education , Balochistan and the Headmaster of Government High School, Kuchlak . The suit was decreed because neither party seriously contested it and the evidence produced by the Respondent remained un -rebutted . Through the said judgment and decree it was declared that the correct date of birth of Respondent No.1 was 25.12.1961.

[7] The Court directed the Chairman Boar d of Intermediate and Secondary Education, Balochistan and the Headmaster, Government High School, Kuchlak to correct the record by entering the date of birth of the Respondent as 25.12.1961 instead of 08.01.1959. It appears that on the basis of the said d ecree, the Respondent got his secondary school certificate changed to reflect his corrected date of birth .

[8] He also got the school record amended on the basis of the judgment and decree dated 07.09.1989. Interestingly enough, he appears to have moved an app lication with the Secretary, Services and CIVIL APPEALS NO.507 & 604 OF 2020. 3 General Administration Department, Government of Balochistan seeking correction of his date of birth.

[9] Vide order dated 07.04.1991, the application was rejected by the competent authority on the ground that the rele vant rules did not allow alteration in the date of birth once recorded on the basis of matriculation certificate. The Respondent did not agitate the matter any further till notification dated 18.10.2018 was issued by the Secretary , Services and General Administration Department, Quetta on the basis of which the Respondent was retired having attained the age of superannuation with effect from 07.01.2019 .

[10] The date of superannuation was calculated on the basis of date of birth being 08.01. 1959 as was originall y recorded in his service record . 3. The Respondent made a fresh representation before the Secretary, Services and General Administration Department for correction of his date of birth and h ence extension of his service s for a period more than two years .

[11] This request was again declined. The Respondent No.1 therefore approached the Balochistan Service Tribunal with a service appeal . This appeal was allowed by the Tribunal through the impugned judgment. 4. Leave to appeal was granted by this Court on 08.05.2020 in the following terms: “The learned Advocate General, Balochistan contends that the Respondent was employed in 1984.

[12] In the CIVIL APPEALS NO.507 & 604 OF 2020. 4 year 1991, he had applied for change of his date of birth, which was rejected vide order dated 07.04.1991 that was a ccepted by the Respondent, as he did not challenge the same further rather in the year 2018 when he was at the verge of retirement he filed a service appeal before the Balochistan Service Tribunal.

[13] This appeal was hopelessly time barred and was not maintai nable. He submits that once the date of birth is recorded in service record at the time of joining Government service, the same could not be changed as per settled law more particularly, in terms of Section 11 of the Balochistan Civil Servants (Appointment , Promotion and Transfer) Rules, 2009. 2.

[14] The learned Law Officer has further contended that the Respondent had filed a suit in the year 1989 for correction of his date of birth in which he managed to obtain an ex -parte decree dated 07.08.1989. He conten ds that as the petitioners -Respondent department were not party in the said suit, therefore, the judgment passed therein has no binding effect on the petitioners.

[15] He adds that even otherwise the said judgment obtained by the petitioner was altogether illegal, as such the same has not been approved by the superior Courts. In support of his contentions the learned Law Officer has relied upon judgments of this Court reported as Ali Azhar Khan Baloch v. Province of Sindh (2015 SCMR 456) and Muhammad Aslam Baloc h v.

[16] Government of Balochistan (2014 SCMR 1723). 3. The submissions made by the learned Advocate General Balochistan need consideration. Leave to appeal is therefore granted to consider inter alia the same. Appeal stage paper books be prepared on the av ailable record. However, the parties are at liberty to file additional documents, if any within a period of one month.

[17] As the matter relates to service, the Office is directed to fix the same for hearing in Court expeditiously, preferably after three month s. 4. In the meantime, operation of the impugned judgment dated 30.08.2019 shall remain suspended.” CIVIL APPEALS NO.507 & 604 OF 2020. 5 5. The learned Advocate General, Balochistan has argued that the Balochistan Service Tribunal failed to take into consideration the fact that the actual date of birth of Respondent No.1 was 08.01.1959 which was mentioned by him in his form s filed before the Balochistan Public Service Commission.

[18] The form is in his own handwriting. Further, the date of birth mentioned in the form was also mentioned in the matriculation certificate which was made part of the service record of the Respondent. He submits that the Balochistan Service Tribunal failed to notice that the question of change of date of birth had been agitated even earlier in 1981 when the Respondent filed an application for correction of his date of birth after obtaining a decree of the Court .

[19] However , such application was rejected . The Respondent did not agitate the matter any further and remained silent till 2018 when the notification f or his retir ement was issued. On issu ance of the notification , he filed a fresh application, the same was rejected and he used such rejection as a cause of action to file a service appeal which was patently barred by time and without cause of action.

[20] He further mainta ins that his silence of over 20 years operates as an estoppel and the Respondent was barred from approaching the Balochistan Service Tribunal. 6. The learned Advocate General, Balochistan further submits that the Balochistan Service Tribunal failed to n otice or consider the impact of Rule 3(6) of the Balochistan Government Initial Appointment to the Civil Service post (age CIVIL APPEALS NO.507 & 604 OF 2020. 6 and relaxation of upper age limit) Rules, 2012 which provides that the date of birth of a civil servant once recorded at the time of joining Government service shall be final and no alteration therein shall be permissible except where a clerical mistake occur s in recording the date of birth in the service record.

[21] The learned Advocate General further maintains that the Balochistan Serv ice Tribunal has failed to take into consideration the dictum of this Court in respect of change of date of birth under the provision of Rule 12 -A of the Civil Servants (Appointments, Promotions and Transfers) Rules, 1973 as well as the ratio of the law la id down in various judgments of this Court including Qamaruddin. v.

[22] Pakistan through Secretary, Establishment Division, Islamabad and another (2007 SCMR 66) , Dr. Muhammad Aslam Baloch v. Government of Balochistan through Secretary, Health Department and ot hers (2014 SCMR 1723) , Ali Azhar Khan Baloch and others v. Province of Sindh and others (2015 SCMR 456) and Dr.

[23] Zulfiqat Ahmed Malik v. Federation of Pakistan through Secretary Revenue Division, Chairman FBR, Islamabad and others (2019 SCMR 1973 ). 7. The learned counsel for the Respondent, on the other hand, has defended the impugned judgment. He has vehemently argued that the date of birth of the Respondent was wrongly recorded in the form s of the Public Service Commission as well as his matriculation ce rtificate.

[24] He had accordingly approached a Court of competent jurisdiction and got his correct date of birth declared through a declaratory CIVIL APPEALS NO.507 & 604 OF 2020. 7 decree. Such decree has remained unchallenged and the Government of Balochistan ha d no option except to implement th e judgment and decree which had attained finality.

[25] He further maintains that in a number of subsequent ACRs which also constitute a part of his service record , his correct date of birth i.e. 25.12.1961 has been recorded . He therefore maintains that the Gov ernment of Balochistan has acquiesced in the matter , the judgment and decree have attained finality and the Balochistan Service Tribunal was within its powers and legally justified in implementing the judgment of the Additional District Judge -II, Quetta da ted 07.09.1989. 8.

[26] We have heard the learned counsel for the parties and carefully examined the record. 9. It is clear and obvious to us that before joining service the Respondent filed an application form in order to sit for the civil service examin ation. In the said form which the Respondent filled in his own hand and was duly signed by him, he mentioned his date of birth as 08.01.1959.

[27] The form was accompanied by his Secondary school certificate which also reflected the same date of birth. Likewise , the same date of birth was entered in his serv ice record from the day he joined service and was not changed within the timeframe provided by law. It is by now well settled that date of birth of a civil servant once recorded in his service book and other service record at the time of his entry into the Government CIVIL APPEALS NO.507 & 604 OF 2020. 8 service cannot be changed , except where an error occurred in recording the correct date of birth on account of a clerical error. 10.

[28] Further, all relevant service rules including the Rule 3(6) of the Balochistan Government Initial Appointment to the Civil Service post (age and relaxation of upper age limit) Rules, 2012 as well as the Civil Servants (Appointments, Promotions and Transfers) Rules, 1973 are clear and categorical in this respect and deviation from the same is neither permissible nor desirable.

[29] We find that the Balochistan Service Tribunal altogether ignored the rules for reasons best known to it. 11. We also note that the Respondent filed a declaratory suit in 1988 and obtained a judgment and decree dated 07.09.1989. It is however significant to note that he only impleaded Chairman, Board of Intermediate and Secondary Education, Balochistan Quetta and the Headmaster, Government High School, Kuchl ak in his suit .

[30] He did not implead h is employer namely, the Government of Balochistan which was the most material and necessary party in the suit in question. Further, armed with the said judgment and decree, he filed an application for alteration in his date of birth which was rightly decli ned vide letter dated 07.04.1991 issued by the Government of Balochistan , Services and General Administration Department.

[31] He did not agitate this mat ter any further which became past and closed CIVIL APPEALS NO.507 & 604 OF 2020. 9 transaction. Thereafter, the Respondent kept qui et for the next 17 years. It was only on the eve of his retirement when the notification f or his retirement was issued, that he moved an application agitating the matter again knowing that the request had already been declined in 1991 , and thereafter filed the service a ppeal.

[32] This in our opinion was a malafide and seemingly clever attempt to hoodwi nk the system and extend his date of retirement by a few years. 12. The argument of the learned counsel for the Respondent that Government of Balochistan did not challenge the judgment and decree which had attained finality and it was bound to implement it is misconceived and without substance.

[33] In the first place , even the maintainability of the suit was questionable on account of clear and elaborate rules available in the Se rvice Rules . Further, the Government of Balochistan which was a necessary party was not impleaded and the judgment in question was neither binding nor executable against the Government of Balochistan.

[34] We also find that the service appeal filed by the Respo ndent was patently barred by time and the said fact unfortunately escaped the notice of the Balochistan Service Tribunal. We also find it surprising that the Balochistan Service Tribunal not only ignored and failed to take notice of clear and unambiguous s ervice rules including the Rule 3(6) of the Balochistan Government Initial Appointment to the Civil Service post (age and relaxation of upper age limit) Rules, 2012 but also the provision s of the Balochistan Civil Servants CIVIL APPEALS NO.507 & 604 OF 2020. 10 (Appointments, Promotions and Tra nsfers) Rules, 1973 .

[35] Most significantly the Tribunal totally failed to consider , appreciate and follow the dict a of this Court recorded in Qamaruddin. v. Pakistan through Secretary, Establishment Division, Islamabad and another , Dr. Muhammad Aslam Baloch v . Government of Balochistan through Secretary, Health Department and others , Ali Azhar Khan Baloch and others v.

[36] Province of Sindh and others and Dr. Zulfiqat Ahmed Malik v. Federation of Pakistan through Secretary Revenue Division, Chairman FBR, Islamabad and others (supra ) where it has repeatedly been held that the date of birth once recorded in the service record of a civil servant cannot be altered or changed except in accordance with the exception s provided in the rules itself .

[37] It was never the case of the Respondent that his case fell within any of the exception s or that his date of birth was wrongly recorded on account of a clerical error. 13. The Balochistan Service Tribunal also failed to take notice into consideration that in the year 1991 the competent authority had already rejected the representation of the Respondent and the Respondent had remained silent for 18 years before agitating the matter before the Balochistan Service Tribunal.

[38] The Balochistan Service Tribunal did not consider it neces sary to record any reasons for entertaining the service appeal, condoning the delay, ignoring the clear, unambiguous and unequivocal language of the rules and consistent dicta on the question of law settled by this Court in the various judgment s cited abov e.

[39] It may be noted that in CIVIL APPEALS NO.507 & 604 OF 2020. 11 terms of Article 189 of the Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, 1973 , any decision of this Court to the extent that it decide s a question of law or is based upon or enunciates a principle of law is binding on all other Courts in Pakistan.

[40] On this yardstick, the judgment of the Tribunal is per incuriam . 14. For reasons recorded above, we allow this appeal . We find the judgment of the Balochistan Service Tribunal, Quetta dated 30.08.2019 to be unsustainable . It is accordingly set aside. 15. The Registrar shall communicate a copy of this judgment to the Balochistan Service Tribunal, Quetta.
