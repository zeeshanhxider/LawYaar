[1] order dated 14.11.2019 passed by the Peshawar High Cour t Peshawar passed in Cr.A. No. 104-P/2019 ) State through Director ANF (in both cases_ …Petitioner (s) Versus Aurangzeb (in Cr.P..26 -P/2020) Malook (in Cr.P.27 -P/2020) …Res pondent (s) For the Petitioner (s): Mr. Muhammad Tariq, Special Prosec utor, ANF ( in both cases) For the Respondent(s) : N.R. ( in both cases) Date of hearing: 28.07.2021 ORDER Qazi Muhammad Amin Ahmed , J.- Commonality of the issue binding Cr.

[2] P.26 -P of 2020 with Cr. P.27 -P of 2020 , directed against Aurangzeb and Mal ook, respondents , respectively , necessitates a joint consideration. The respondents were hauled up , on 28.11.2017, by a contingent of Anti -Narcotic Force Peshawar with 18.600 kilograms of methamphetamine , a synthetic psychoactive drug, designated as a contraband within the contemplation of section 8 of the Control of Narcotic Substances Act , 1997; it comprised of 34000 tablets , wrapped in pack ets, comprising two lots , separately secured from different points ; 34 tablets from each lot were sent for forensic analysis that confirmed their narcotic character as “Metamfetamine , Benzodiazepine, Phencyclindine And Morphine” . 2.

[3] Indicted under clause ( c) of Section 9 of the Act ibid , respondents claimed trial that resulted into their conviction thereunder ; vide j udgment dated 29.01.2019 , they were sentenced to imprisonment for life with a direction to pay fine in the sum of rupees one million each; the High Court, however, considering the samples for forensic Criminal Petition No. 26 & 27 -P/2020 2 analysis as deficient in terms of law declared by this Court in Ameer Zaib case (PLD 2012 SC 383) altered their conviction in appeals , separately filed by the convicts, into clause (a) of the section ibid and reduced their sentence s to the period s already undergone by them with a substantial reduction in the f ine vide impugned judgment dated 14.11.2019 , vires whereof, are being assailed on the ground s that there was no occasion for the High Court after maintaining the conviction s to reduce convicts’ sentences on a premise hardly sustainable in law .

[4] The learned counsel elaborated his point of view by arguing that the High Court had misdirected itself to apply the principle laid down in the supra case in disregard to the nature, shape and format of the contraband, uniquely integrated into small tablet form , incapa ble of traditional sampling suggested in the case; he next argued that the Control of Narcotic Substances Act covered a wide range of “narcotic drugs, psychotropic substances or controlled substances ” manufactured , marketed and administered through various mediums other than usual chunk s of shaped pieces and, thus, in the peculiar circumstances of case, dispatch of 34 tablets , from each lot, squarely constituted representative samples , leaving no space for a contra hypothesis .

[5] Any other interpretation or ap proach would defeat the legislative intent and purpose, concluded the learned Law Officer . Leave is granted to examine the validity of above position. Send for the respondent s through bailable warrant s in the sum of Rs.200,000/ - each, returnable to the Ass istant Registrar of this Court at Peshawar.

[6] Station House Officer shall execute the warrant s within a fortnight. Judge Judge Peshawar , the 28th July, 2021 Not approved for reporting Azmat /-
