[3] Record transpired that on checking 26 foreign origin Iphones valuing rupees 78,46,798/- were recovered from the petitioner while she was passing through the green channel of arrival hall at the Allama Iqbal International Airport, Lahore and was arrested on the spot. Both the courts below have declined the post-arrest bail considering that the offence alleged against the petitioner falls within the prohibitory clause of section 497 Cr.P.C.

[4] In view of the above, this petition is converted into an appeal and is allowed. The impugned order dated5. Admittedly, the petitioner is a woman and her case should have been examined by the courts below under first proviso to section 497(1) Cr.P.C if she was not found entitled to bail under section 497(1) Cr.P.CL The courts below should have considered the bail application of the petitioner on its own merits taking into account the petitioner ’s background, nature of offence and the likelihood of abscondence.

[5] The court ’s decision to dismiss the bail application solely based on the sentence prescribed under the law is unjust as there are precedents where courts have granted bail in cases where the prescribed sentence was significant. Apart from above, the petitioner has no criminal history and there is no apprehension of her abscondence.

[6] The travel history of the petitioner alone is not a sufficient ground to believe that she was engaged in such kind of illegal activities. Besides, the prosecution has already gathered all necessaiy evidence and the petitioner is no more required for custodial interrogation, therefore, keeping her in jail without a court verdict would be equivalent to convicting the petitioner without due process. * -3- 09.09.2024 is set-aside and the petitioner is admitted to post ­ arrestr 10-Cri.P.L.A.No.l038 of 2024 hail, .subject to furnishing bail bonds in the sum of ^ith two sureties in the like amount, to the satisfaction of the trial court.
