[36] The above four appeals arise out of a judgment of the Sindh High Court passed in Constitution Petitions No. D-6 43 to D-646 of 2004. CA 778-2005 ETC 17 The respondent M/S Honda Shahra-e-Faisal, an associ ation of persons, namely, Shaikh Afzal Maqbool, Shaikh Mubashir Maqbo ol and Shaikh Amjad Maqbool, respondents in Civil Appeals No. 877 , 878 & 879 of 2005 derived income from sale of spare parts and worksho p receipts.

[37] The assessments in respect of the aforesaid respondents pertaining to the assessment year 2002-2003 were finalized on 20.05.2 003 under section 59(1) of the Income Tax Ordinance, 1979 (hereinafte r referred to as the repealed Ordinance). The Additional Commissioner of Income Tax, Range- II, Companies Zone-I, Karachi initiated proceedings under section 122 (5A) of the Ordinance calling upon the respondents to sh ow cause as to why the above finalized assessments be not amended.

[38] Agg rieved thereof, the respondents filed Constitution Petitions before the High Court of Sindh taking the plea that since subsection (5A) of secti on 122 was inserted by the Finance Act, 2003 dated 17.06.2003, effective f rom 01.07.2003, therefore, the same could not be given retrospectiv e effect and consequently it would not be applicable to the asse ssments finalized before 01.07.2003.

[39] The learned High Court, vide its judgment dated 02.03.2005 (hereinafter to be referred to as the Honda Shahra-e-Faisal ) allowed the petitions and held that the provision c ontained in subsection (5A) of section 122 of the Ordinance, inserted with effect from 01.07.2003 was not retrospective in operation.

[40] It was held tha t the assessments finalized before the said date could not be reopene d/revised/ amended in exercise of the jurisdiction conferred upon the inc ome tax authorities under the above provision. Thus, the impugned notices wer e declared to be without jurisdiction, illegal and void ab initio and were quashed along with the relevant proceedings, hence the above appeals b y the department by leave of this Court.

[41] CA 778-2005 ETC 18 3. The Constitution Petitions, which are the subje ct-matter of C.As. No. 1601 to 1603 of 2006 were also filed in t he High Court of Sindh against the issuance of show cause notices in more or less similar circumstances and were decided on the basis of Honda Shahra-e-Faisal . 4. Civil Appeals No. 1604 to 1625, 2670 to 2683, & 2685 to 2687 of 2006; 585 to 595, 706, 707, 1369 to 1404, & 1984 to 2046 of 2007; 291, 292, 459 to 499, 870 & 1847 to 1849 of 2008, 30 to 32 of 2009 also arise out of judgments of the High Court of Sindh passed in the tax references filed by the appellants.

[42] Here too, the judgment in Honda Shahra-e-Faisal was followed. 5. Civil Appeals No. 803 to 839 of 2008 arise out of judgments of the Lahore High Court, Multan Bench delivered in th e tax references filed before it on the following question of law: - “Whether on the facts and circumstances of the cas e, the learned ITAT was justified in holding that section 122(5) of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 brought into statute thr ough Finance Act, 2003 is not applicable to the assessments comp leted before the promulgation of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, whe reas the amendment brought in through Finance Ordinance, 200 2 in subsection (1) of section 122 extends the applicabi lity of section 122 to the assessments completed under the provisions o f the Income Tax Ordinance, 1979 as well.” 6.

[43] Vide judgment dated 2.4.2008, a learned Divisio n Bench of the Lahore High Court at Multan, following the law laid down in Honda Shahra-e-Faisal answered the aforesaid question in the affirmative and held that section 122(5A) did not have retrospectiv e effect qua the assessments finalized before 1.7.2002, and as such could not be reopened/revised or amended in the exercise of juri sdiction under section 122(5A) of the Ordinance.

[44] Resultantly, the tax refe rences were rejected. CA 778-2005 ETC 19 7. Civil Appeals No. 840 to 1039, 1104 to 1127, 14 91 to 1513, 2257 to 2311 of 2008, 7 to 9, 33 to 57 of 2009 aris e out of judgments of the Lahore High Court, Lahore delivered in the tax refe rences filed before it wherein it was held that the assessment orders fram ed by the Deputy Commissioner of Income Tax could not be amended or modified under any of the two subsections, namely (5) and (5A) of sect ion 122 of the Ordinance.

[45] It was further held that the language of section 122 applied only to assessment orders finalized by the Commissi oner in respect of the taxpayers for the tax year and not to the assessmen t orders made by the DCIT for the assessment years 2002-2003 and earlier . All the tax references were rejected. 8.

[46] Civil Appeal No. 1322 of 2007 arises out of jud gment of the Lahore High Court, Lahore passed in Writ Petition f iled against the show cause notice issued to the respondent. In this case , the Lahore High Court held that the impugned show cause notice, which was issued under the Ordinance as amended by SRO No.633(I)/2002 dated 14 .9.2002 was not sustainable in law after the above SRO was declared ultra vires the Ordinance by this Court in the case of Commissioner of Income Tax v.

[47] Kashmir Edible Oils Ltd (2006 SCMR 109). It was also held that the subsequent insertion of these amendments through th e Finance Act, 2003 also did not cure the illegality of the amendments made in the Ordinance through the said SRO. It was noted that the impugne d show cause notice could not be issued under the Ordinance as it exist ed at the time of its enforcement, i.e., prior to any amendments whether made under the SRO or the Finance Act, 2003.

[48] As such, the impugned sho w cause notice was declared to be illegal and of no legal effect. CA 778-2005 ETC 20 9. Civil Appeals No. 1148 to 1150 and 1245 of 2008 arise out judgments of the Lahore High Court, Rawalpindi Benc h delivered in the tax references filed before it wherein it was held that the Ordinance applied to the tax year commencing from 1.7.2002.

[49] The provisio ns of section 122(5) as on that date neither covered the assessments fin alized under the repealed Ordinance nor the operation of law was mad e retrospective in various corresponding provisions. The new law was m ore favourable to the taxpayers as against the revenue department terms, which was apparent from the terms, such as ‘taxpayer’ vis-à-vis ‘asses see’. 10.

[50] Civil Appeals No. 500, 501 & 783 to 791 of 200 8, and 163 and 164 of 2009 arise out of judgments of the Islamabad High Court, delivered in the tax references filed before it. The learned Islamabad High Court disposed of the tax references in the light of the law laid down in Honda Shahra-e-Faisal . 11.

[51] Civil Appeals No. 115 to 118 of 2008, 112, 113 , 122, 123 & 281 to 283 of 2009 and Civil Petitions No. 12 & 13 of 2009 arise out of judgments of the Peshawar High Court, delivered in the tax references filed before it. The learned Peshawar High Court ad hered to the exposition of law made by the Sindh and the Lahore High Courts and held that subsection (5A) of section 122 of the Ordinance ins erted with effect from 1.7.2003 was not applicable to the assessments fina lized before 1.7.2003 because subsection (5A) had no retrospective effect and, therefore, the assessments finalized before 1.7.2003 could not be reopened/revised/amended in exercise of jurisdictio n under section 122 (5A) of the Ordinance. 12.

[52] In the appeals arising out of the judgments o f the High Courts (Lahore High Court, Lahore, Multan, Rawalpindi & Ba hawalpur Benches, CA 778-2005 ETC 21 Islamabad High Court and the Peshawar High Court) l eave was granted by this Court to examine, inter alia , the scope, effect and validity of subsections (1), (5), (5A) of section 122 of the Or dinance inserted w.e.f. 1.7.2003 by the Finance Act, 2003. 13.

[53] To illustrate the factual mattress upon which the tax references were founded, we narrate here the facts of one case from the Multan Bench. The assessments in respect of Khalid Javaid, respondent in C.A. No.  relating to years 1998-1999, 1999 -2000 & 2002-2003, completed on 30.10.2000, 29.9.1999 and 15.1.2003 re spectively, were framed and finalized under section 62 of the repeal ed Ordinance before 1.7.2002, i.e. the date on which the Ordinance was enforced.

[54] The IAC concerned issued show cause notice dated 19.6.2004 to the respondent for imposition of correct amount of tax for the afo resaid years under section 122(5) of the Ordinance. The respondent cha llenged the show cause notice in appeal before the Commissioner of I ncome Tax (Appeals), Multan. In his order dated 29.3.2005, the Commissio ner, placed reliance on the judgment of the High Court of Sindh in Honda Shahra-e-Faisal , allowed the appeal of the respondent and cancelled the amended assessment orders passed under section 122 of the O rdinance.

[55] Thus, the original assessment orders finalized under section 59 of the repealed Ordinance were restored. The Commissioner decided t he issue on the legal plane and gave no finding on other grounds of appeal. The CIT Multan Zone then agitated the matter before the Inc ome Tax Appellate Tribunal, Lahore Bench, but without any success and the order of the Commissioner was upheld.

[56] The CIT Multan Zone therea fter filed tax reference (TR No. ) before the Lahore High C ourt, Multan Bench with the following question of law for determinatio n by the said Court: - CA 778-2005 ETC 22 “Whether on the facts and circumstances of the cas e, the learned ITAT was justified in holding that section 122(5) of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 brought into statute thr ough Finance Act, 2003 is not applicable to the assessments comp leted before the promulgation of the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001, whe reas the amendment brought in through Finance Ordinance, 200 2 in subsection (1) of section 122 extends the applicabi lity of section 122 to the assessments completed under the provisions o f the Income Tax Ordinance, 1979 as well.” 14.

[57] Vide judgment dated 2.4.2008, a learned Divisi on Bench of the Lahore High Court, Multan Bench, following the law laid down in Honda Shahra-e-Faisal answered the aforesaid question in the affirmative and held that section 122(5A) had no retrospective effe ct qua the assessments finalized before 1.7.2002 and as such could not be reopened/revised or amended in the exercise of jurisdiction under secti on 122(5A) of the Ordinance.

[58] Resultantly, the tax references were rej ected. It is noteworthy that all the cases were decided on the legal issue and not a single case was decided on merits. 15. The moot point in these appeals is the retrosp ective application or otherwise of the provisions of secti on 122(1), (5) & (5A) of the Ordinance.

[59] A common contention of the learned c ounsel for the appellants was that the High Courts were not right in holding that the said provisions had no retrospective effect. According t o the learned counsel, the said provisions were procedural in nature, they did not create any charge or levy any tax and merely dealt with the ma chinery of assessment, therefore, as held in Commissioner of Income Tax v.

[60] Mahaliram Ramjidas (AIR 1940 Privy Council 124), in interpreting provisions of this kind the rule was that such cons truction should be preferred which made the machinery workable. CA 778-2005 ETC 23 16. Mr. M. Ilyas Khan, learned counsel for the app ellants in C.A. No.  contended that section 122(1) as amend ed by the Finance Ordinance, 2002 was part of the Ordinance from the very date of enforcement, i.e. 1.7.2002.

[61] He submitted that subse ction (1) was an enabling provision and the power of amendment confe rred therein was to be exercised subject to other provisions of section 122 while subsections (5) & 5A) were procedural in nature and non-chargin g provisions but were to be read in conjunction with subsection (1), whic h explicitly provided for the amendment of assessment already finalized under the repealed Ordinance.

[62] He submitted that reference to various s ections of the repealed Ordinance in subsection (1) of section 122 of the Ordinance clearly showed the intention of the legislature to apply the provision relating to amendment of assessment retrospectively with the rider that an assessment could be amended subject to time-limits provided in subsections (2) & (4A).

[63] Subsection (5A) of section 122 would be attracted on fulfillment of the twin conditions, namely, the erroneousness of the assessment and its being prejudicial to the interes t of revenue to the assessments relating to the income year ending on o r before 30.6.2002 finalized before 1.7.2003 under the repealed Ordina nce, the date of insertion of the above subsection.

[64] On the other han d, if the applicability of subsection (5A) were restricted to the orders treat ed to be issued under the Ordinance alone, it would render the words ‘ erroneous in so far it is prejudicial to the interest of revenue ’ a surplusage against the legislative intent. Subsections (5) and (5A) were procedural pr ovisions as the same fell in Chapter X of the Ordinance, which related t o procedure.

[65] It was well- settled principle of interpretation of fiscal statu tes that only charging provisions would not be given retrospective effect but the procedural CA 778-2005 ETC 24 provisions could well be applied retrospectively. T he retrospectivity of a statute was either expressly conferred or could be inferred by necessary implication therein.

[66] The charging provisions were t o be construed strictly, whereas the procedural provisions were to be interp reted liberally. He also pressed into service other principles of interpreta tion of statutes, namely, every word in a statute to be given a meaning, a st atute to be read as a whole, words to be construed in accordance with the intention, a law should be interpreted in such a manner that it shou ld be saved rather than destroyed, the courts lean in favour of upholding c onstitutionality of legislation and would be extremely reluctant to str ike down laws as unconstitutional, enactments dealing with procedure are always retrospective in the sense that they apply to the p ending proceedings, the rule that fiscal statutes should be construed stric tly was applicable only to a charging provision or a provision imposing penalt y, scheme of the law is to be examined in its totality in order to arrive a t a correct conclusion, no provision is to be considered in isolation, court m ay modify language of statute to give effect to manifest and undoubted in tention of the legislature, procedural matters would not operate r etrospectively if they touch a right in existence at the time of passing o f the legislation, where retrospective effect to a statute is not given expr essly, one must, apart from the language employed, look to the general sco pe and purview of the statute and at the remedy sought to be applied and consider what was the former state of the law, and what was that the legi slature contemplated, etc.

[67] He referred to Halsbury’s Laws of England, vol . 36, 3 rd edition, p. 423, Craies on Statute Law, fifth edition, p. 370, 371, Maxwell’s Interpretation of Statutes, p. 228, Hakim Khan v. Government of Pakistan (PLD 1992 SC 595), etc. He further argued that with the repeal o f the Ordinance (of CA 778-2005 ETC 25 1979), no right was accrued to or conferred upon th e assessees nor had they acquired any right inasmuch as section 122(1) clearly provided that the assessments made or deemed to have been made we re open to amendment within a specified time-limit.

[68] Erroneous assessment prejudicial to the interest of revenue could not be termed a past and closed transaction. He submitted that the Commissio ner was the authority empowered to amend or further amend an assessment, and though he was empowered to delegate his powers or functions u nder section 210, but by virtue of amendment made in the said section by insertion of subsection (1A), he was debarred from delegating hi s powers of amendment of assessment contained in subsection (5A ) of section 122 to a taxation officer below the rank of Additional Com missioner of Income Tax.

[69] He further submitted that the power of amendm ent envisaged under subsection (5) was original in nature while the one under subsection (5A) was revisional in nature. He adopted the reasoning of a learned Single Judge of the High Court of Sindh in the case of Fauji Oil Terminal and Distribution Co. Ltd.

[70] Karachi v. Additional Commiss ioner/Taxation Officer (2006 PTD 734) that once an assessment order was tr eated as issued under section 120 or was actually issued under sect ion 121, then the same could be amended or further amended on fulfill ment of conditions specified in subsection (5) only and on no other gr ound, and that subsections (1), (3) and (5) were to be read togeth er and not in isolation.

[71] He lastly submitted that the assessees or the taxpa yers were not fair in disclosing their true incomes. There were countless cases of concealed income, etc. The assessees were not prepared to fac e the realities and instead of approaching the department, they filed w rit petitions in the High CA 778-2005 ETC 26 Courts against the law laid down in Pak Arab Fertilizers (Pvt.) Ltd. v.

[72] Deputy Commissioner Income Tax (2000 PTD 263). 17. Mr. Akhtar Ali Mehmood, ASC, learned counsel f or the appellant in C.A. No.  submitted that retro spectivity of the provisions of the Ordinance was evident from the ac tions being taken according to the scheme of the said Ordinance. In s upport of his submission, the learned counsel placed reliance on an order of the Commissioner of Income Tax whereby he delegated pow ers to the Taxation Officers (Additional Commissioner, etc.) p assed after the enforcement of the Ordinance.

[73] He further referred t o the case of Commissioner of Income Tax, Multan v. Munazza Iqbal , the subject- matter of C.As. No. 805 & 806 of 2008 in which reli ef was allowed to the respondent, though the case was not covered by SRO No. 633(I)/2002 dated 14.9.2002. He also placed on record a copy of the order dated 13.1.2009 passed by this Court in the case of Commissioner (Legal Division), Large Taxpayer Unit v.

[74] M/S Shaheen Air I nternational (C.Ps. No. 511-K to 513-K of 2008 decided on 13.01.2009). This case related to rectification of assessment orders under section 22 1 of the Ordinance, passed on 25.10.1999 in respect of assessment years 1997-98 and 1998- 99 as well as the assessment order dated 25.5.2000, in respect of assessment year 1999-00.

[75] In this case, the appellat e authority as well as the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal had taken the vie w that the provisions of section 221 were applicable to assessments made after the enforcement of the Ordinance and therefore the powe r of rectification could only be exercised within the time-limit of fo ur years laid down in section 156 of the repealed Ordinance.

[76] CA 778-2005 ETC 27 18. Mr. Shahid Jamil Khan, ASC, learned counsel fo r the appellant submitted that under sections 65 and 66A of the repealed Ordinance read with section 6 of the General Clause s, 1897 an assessment could be amended, revised or reassessed subject to the provisions of law where it was found that the exact or proper tax, levied under the charging section, was not assessed, and n o sanctity was attached to the assessment orders.

[77] The taxpayer did not have any vested right in a case of escaped income, or an erroneous assessment, etc. The power of the State to levy tax was protected by vir tue of section 6 of the General Clauses Act, 1897. Section 122 provided mac hinery for the enforcement of charging provisions, therefore, the same were not debarred from being applied retrospectively.

[78] He relied upon the case of Nawabzada Muhammad Amir Khan (PLD 1961 SC 119) to emphasize that it was the duty of the Court to protect the right of the State by having recourse to the principles of harmonious construction and reconcili ng the conflicting provisions, or by curing the flaws in the language employed by the lawmaker.

[79] He referred to Salmon v. Duncombe (11 AC 634) where it was held that the machinery sections were to be liberal ly construed and if the incidence of tax was clear, the machinery sections should be so construed as to make the realization of the proper tax possib le. He submitted that the defects in the language of the law could not be mad e a basis to defeat the intention of the legislature or to prevent the real ization of tax that was in fact due. 19.

[80] Mr. M. Bilal, Sr. ASC for the appellants in C. A. No. 163-  and Raja Abdul Ghafoor, ASC/AOR for the pe titioner in C.P. No.  & and appellants in C.As. No. , & 115-118 & 1491- CA 778-2005 ETC 28  adopted the arguments advanced by M/S M. Ilyas Khan and Akhtar Ali Mehmood, ASCs. 20. Syed Naveed Andrabi, ASC for the respondent in C.A.

[81] No. 778 of 2005 made the following submissions: - (1) At the time of promulgation of the Ordinance, a bout 1000 amendments were made to make the new law in line wi th the repealed Ordinance. The entire complexion of the la w was changed (2) Subsection 1 of section 122 of the Ordinance wa s an independent provision which had no nexus with subse ction (5- A); (3) The pending proceedings initiated under the pro visions of the repealed Ordinance were saved under subsection (4) of section 239 of the Ordinance; and (4) Vested rights had accrued to the assessees befo re the enforcement of the Ordinance, 2001, hence, the inco me tax authorities, under the Ordinance, 2001 did not have any lawful authority to reopen the assessment orders passed in favour of the assessees by the authorities under the repealed Ordinance.

[82] Reference was made to the cases of Kashmir Edible Oil Ltd v. Federation of Pakistan [2005 (91) Tax 480 Lahore] = 2005 PTD 1621 and United Builders Corporation, Mirpur v. Commissioner Income-tax, Govt. of Azad J & K (1984 PTD 137) = 49 (tax) 34. 21. Mr. Mansoorul Arifin, ASC, learned counsel for the respondent in C.A.

[83] No. 876 to 879 of 2005, supporting the impu gned judgment of the High Court of Sindh in Honda Shahra-e-Faisal , made the following submissions: - (1) The Ordinance, as originally promulgated, broug ht about change in its approach towards and treatment of the taxpayers by introducing a liberal tax regime, e.g., under se ction 120 of the Ordinance, where a taxpayer furnished a return of income, CA 778-2005 ETC 29 the Commissioner shall be taken to have made an assessment of the taxable income.

[84] This changed appr oach lay at the foundation of the Ordinance and was the touc hstone to judge the validity of the subsequent actions; (2) The provisions of section 122 clearly showed th at the legislature, through a conscious application of min d, kept outside the ambit of the provisions of the Ordinanc e the assessments of the period ending on 30.6.2002.

[85] It w as only through an arbitrary amendment process, undertaken through the Finance Ordinance, 2002, the SRO dated 14.9.200 2 and the Finance Act, 2003 that the assessments of the p eriod preceding the enforcement of the Ordinance were bro ught within its pale; (3) Subsection (5A) was applicable to the tax year 2003 and onward because the Ordinance was operative from 1.7 .2002, therefore, the same could not be applied to the ass essments of the period preceding its enforcement unless the law specifically so provided.

[86] Reference was made to the cases of Calcutta Discount Co. v. Income-Tax Officer [(1952) 21 ITR 579 (Calcutta)], Niranjanlal Ramballabh v. Commissioner of Income-Tax, Madhya Pradesh [(1953) 23 131)], Commissioner of Income-Tax v. Maharaja Pratap Singh Bahadur [(1956) 30 ITR 484 (Patna)], Chairman, Central Board of Direct Taxes v.

[87] V.S. Malhotra [(1981) 129 ITR 543 (Delhi)] and N.S. Bindra’s Interpretation of Statut es, Eighth Edition 1997, p. 628; (4) The Commissioner was empowered to amend an asse ssment by insertion of subsection (5) by means of SRO No. 633(I)/2002 dated 14.9.2002, but the same ceased to have effect after the said SRO was rescinded by SRO No. 608(I)/2003 dated 24.6.2003 in pursuance of the jud gment of this Court in the case of Kashmir Edible Oils Ltd (supra); (5) There was nothing in section 239, which indicat ed that the legislature intended to revive section 66A of the r epealed Ordinance, hence the subsequent amendments introduc ed in section 122 with a view to achieving the same objec t were of CA 778-2005 ETC 30 no legal effect, hence proceedings initiated under section 122(5A) in respect of the assessments completed und er the repealed Ordinance were unlawful, which were also h it by the principle of past and closed transactions; and (6) Subsection (5) was not a mere procedural provis ion, which could be applied retrospectively.

[88] Rather, the said provision, if applied retrospectively, would affect the accrued r ights of the assessees, hence the same would be prospective in i ts operation. Reference was made to an order passed b y this Court in an unreported case titled Inspecting Additional Commissioner of Income Tax v. Zakaria H.A.

[89] Sattar B ilwani, Karachi (C.P. No. 643-K to 647 of 2007 decided on 15.7.200 8) wherein it was held that vested rights accruing to an assessee in respect of assessments for the years 1988-89 and 1989-90 finalized on 29.6.1989 and the assessments of 1990- 91 and 1991-92 finalized before 30.6.1992 could not be tak en away in exercise of powers conferred by an amending provisi on, namely, section 17B of the Wealth Tax Act, 1963 eff ective from 30.6.1992. 22.

[90] Dr. Farough Naseem, learned counsel for the re spondent in C.A. No.  raised the following contentions : - (1) The substantive laws would always be prospectiv e while the procedural matters would be retrospective, but wher e the procedural laws affected past and closed transactio ns or existing, accrued, concluded, vested or substantive rights, the same would not be retrospective unless and until th e statute expressly provided for retrospective application of the law.

[91] Thus, the power to revise or reopen any concluded assessment envisaged in subsections (5) or (5A) of section 122 of the Ordinance could not be applied retrospec tively. He referred to a number of judgments of the superior C ourts of Pakistan and India, including Adnan Afzal v. Capt. Sher Afzal (PLD 1969 SC 187), Mushtaq Ahmed v.

[92] District Manager, Govt. Transport Service (1982 SCMR 965), WAPDA v. Capt. CA 778-2005 ETC 31 Nazir Hussain (1986 SCMR 96), Glaxo Laboratories Ltd. V. Inspecting Assistant Commissioner of Income Tax (PLD 1992 SC 549), Mrs. Anjuman Shaheen v. Inspecting Assistant Commissioner of Income Tax (1993 PTD 1113 & 1232), Monnoo Industries Ltd v.

[93] C.I.T. (2001 PTD 1525), Delhi Cloth and General Mills Ltd v. Income Tax Commissioner, Delhi (AIR 1927 PC 242), etc; (2) Reopening/ revision/amendment of assessments wa s penal in nature as the process would expose the taxpayers to penal consequences, hence the issue fell within the domai n of substantive law and was not a matter of mere proced ure.

[94] On that account, the principles governing interpretati on of penal provisions would be applicable in the matter of ame ndment, reopening or revision of concluded assessments; (3) It was well-settled that if there was any doubt about prospectivity or retrospectivity of a particular pr ovision, the Court would resolve it in terms of prospectivity; (4) The provision of section 34 of the Income Tax A ct, 1922 was not pari materia with section 122(5A).

[95] The case of Mahaliram Ramjidas (supra) was incorrectly relied upon by the appella nts as the Privy Council did not decide the issue of re trospectivity of section 34 of the Income Tax Act, 1922; (5) A bare reading of the entire section 122 would show that sub- section (4) of section 122 pertained to the amendme nt under subsection (1) or subsection (3), while in subsecti on (5) reference was only made to the amendment under subs ection (1) or the further amendment under sub-section (4).

[96] Again in subsection (6), the legislature had consciously mad e a distinction between amended orders passed under sub section (1), subsection (4) or subsection (5-A), clearly es tablishing that the intention of the legislature was to create distinct categories. Hence the inescapable conclusion was th at sub- section (1) was independent from subsection 122 (5- A).

[97] This was further endorsed from a reading of subsection ( 5-B), which specified a time-limit for the action under s ubsection (5- A). Time-limit under subsection (1) was not made ap plicable to CA 778-2005 ETC 32 subsection (5-A). This would thus again endorse the contention that sub-section (5-A) was a category co mpletely distinct from subsection (1).

[98] This was also establi shed from the fact that the provision of sub-section (5-A) on ly was made subject to the provision of sub-section (9) and not subsection (1). 23. Mr. Shafqat Mehmood Chohan, ASC, learned couns el for the respondents in C.A. No.  etc., made the fol lowing submissions: - (1) It is necessary to see the scheme of law regard ing assessment year and the assessee.

[99] This law was enfo rced on 1st July, 2002. According to subsection (3) of section 1 of the Ordinance, the Ordinance of 1979 was to be repealed on the date the former came into force as envisaged by sec tion 238; (2) The Ordinance was applicable to the activities of the assessment year commencing from 1.7.2002 and not to the activities of the period preceding its enforcement when the previous law was holding the field; (3) Under section 122, only the Commissioner was th e competent authority to amend an assessment or to further amen d an amended assessment whereas the impugned notices wer e issued by officers of the income-tax department bel ow the rank of the Commissioner, therefore, the notices we re not issued competently; (4) This section imposed additional liability, henc e, it was a penal section creating charge itself because it was diffe rent from the previous section i.e. section 66A according to whic h taxpayer meant any representative of a person who derived an amount chargeable to tax under the repealed Ordinance; (5) Every assessment order could not be amended, so while touching the rights of the taxpayer or assessee, th ere were two conditions, so these conditions itself spoke ab out the rights of an assessee; and CA 778-2005 ETC 33 (6) Section 5-A was pari materia with section 66A and the limitation under the repealed Ordinance for section 66A was four years from the date of the order sought to be revised. 24.

[100] Mr. M. Iqbal Hashmi, ASC, learned counsel for the respondents in C.A. No.  etc., argued as un der: - (1) Section 122(1) authorized the Commissioner to a mend assessment orders passed under sections 59, 59A, 62 , 63 and 65 of the repealed Ordinance; (2) The amendment of assessment involved computatio n of taxable income, which, in respect of period ending on or before 30.6.2002 was to be done under the repealed Ordinance by virtue of subsection (1) of section 23 9 of the Ordinance.

[101] Thus, in case of any conflict between an earlier and a later provision, more specifically between se ction 122(1) and section 239(1), the subsequent provision would prevail; (3) By virtue of section 122(8), section 122(5) wou ld be applicable to income chargeable under the Ordinance as the definition of ‘definite information’ did not includ e the income chargeable under the repealed Ordinance in it; and (4) The alternative submission of the learned couns el was that the appeals be remanded to the Income Tax Appellate Tribunal, as the same were decided, not on merits, but on the legal issue, viz., the prospective applicability of section 122(1), (5) or (5A). 25.

[102] Mr. Sirajuddin Khalid, ASC, learned counsel fo r the respondents in C.A. No.  etc., filed copies of notices issued by the Inspecting Additional Commissioner of Income Ta x under section 122 of the Ordinance in respect of assessment years 199 5-96, 1996-97, 2000- 01. He made the following arguments: - (1) Amendment of assessment or reassessment was ali en to the provisions of section 122 of the Ordinance up to th e assessment year 2002-03; CA 778-2005 ETC 34 (2) The words ‘tax’, ‘taxable income’, and ‘taxpaye r’ used in subsection (6), as defined in section 2(63), 2(64) & (266) of the Ordinance did not include the period of assessm ent occupied by the repealed Ordinance.

[103] Thus, the asses sments of the period up to the repeal of the Ordinance of 1979 did not fall within the scope of section 122 of the Ordinan ce; (3) By virtue of section 239(1), the provisions of the repealed Ordinance relating to computation of total income a nd tax payable thereon shall apply as if the Ordinance had not come into force.

[104] Therefore, the power to amend an assess ment envisaged in section 122(1), (5) or (5A) of the Ord inance would not be available in respect of the assessment orders passed under the repealed Ordinance; (4) Section 122(1) would be invoked only if an asse ssment order was issued or treated as issued; (5) The assessment order treated as issued under se ction 120 or issued under section 121 sought to be amended must be an order of the Commissioner, but if such order merged into an appellate or revisional order, then it would not be amenable to the provisions of section 122(5A); and (6) The orders passed in appeal, revision or refere nce would be outside the purview of section 122(5A) as the Ordin ance did not contain any provision parallel to subsection (1 A) of section 66A of the repealed Ordinance. 26.

[105] Mr. Shahbaz Butt, ASC, learned counsel for the respondents in C.A. No.  etc., filed written submission s along with a comparative chart of different provisions of the in come tax laws, i.e. The Income Tax Act, 1922, the repealed Ordinance and th e Ordinance, the Ordinance as per its original text when it was enfo rced, the amendments made through the Finance Ordinance, 2002, the amend ments made through SRO No. 633(1)/2001 dated 14.09.2002, the a mendments made CA 778-2005 ETC 35 through the Finance Ordinance, 2002 and the Finance Act, 2003.

[106] He made the following arguments: - (1) Notwithstanding the amendment made in subsection (1 ) of section 122, or the addition of subsection (5) or s ubsection (5A), the provisions of section 122 could not be in voked in respect of income year ending on 30 th June, 2002; (2) Subsections (1), (2) and (3) of section 239, as ori ginally enacted, specifically related to the income year en ding on 30 th June, 2002 while subsection (4) thereof related spe cifically to pending proceedings; (3) Subsection (2) of section 239 laid down that in mak ing assessment in respect of any income year ending on or before the 30 th day of June 2002, the provisions of the repealed Ordinance relating to the computation of total inco me and the tax payable thereon shall apply as if this Ordinanc e had not come into force; (4) The key word ‘assessment’ was defined in both the Ordinances, i.e. the repealed Ordinance as well as the Ordinance (of 2001).

[107] The word ‘assessment’ as subst ituted by the Finance Ordinance, 2002, included ‘re-assessmen t’ and ‘amended assessment’, which being the cognate expre ssions, were to be construed accordingly. If the above defi nition was read with section 239(1), it would indicate that an amended assessment would also fall within the connotations of assessment and shall apply accordingly; (5) The words “ to ensure that the taxpayer is liable for the corre ct amount of tax for the tax year to which the assessm ent order relates ” occurring in section 122(1) of the Ordinance were omitted by means of the Finance Act, 2003.

[108] The said words referred to the charging provision as contained in the Ordinance where a charge was created on the basis o f tax year as compared to assessment year used in the rep ealed Ordinance; (6) Section 239 (1), (2) and (3) created charge in acco rdance with the provisions of the repealed Ordinance.

[109] Subsectio n (1) of CA 778-2005 ETC 36 section 239 specifically stated that the computatio n of total income and tax payable thereon shall be that of the repealed Ordinance. Therefore, any charge thus created would be dealt with under the provisions of the repealed Ordinance and not under the Ordinance (of 2001); (7) The power of amendment given in subsection (1) of s ection 122 was not an independent power for the reason tha t the provisions of this section were controlled by its o pening words “subject to this section ”.

[110] Further, this section, as it existed till the tax year ending on 30 th June 2003, was addressed to the taxpayer, which was alien to the income tax proceed ings under the repealed Ordinance, and when it created c harge, it addressed to the tax year, which was an alien conno tation to the income tax proceedings under the repealed Ordin ance.

[111] Thus, in this background, the charge created throug h amendment in respect of a tax year, was missing in respect of an assessment year; (8) Keeping in view the original text of subsection (5) , as it stood at the time of enforcement of the Ordinance, the as sessments completed under any of sections 59, 59A, 62, 63 or 65 of the repealed Ordinance were not covered by it; (9) Though such assessments were brought within the sco pe of subsection (5) by means of SRO No. 633(I)/2002 date d 14.9.2002, yet after its rescission by SRO No. 608( I)/2003 dated 24.6.2003, the same fell out of the scope of subsection (5); and (10) Given the definition of ‘taxpayer’ in section 2(66) of the Ordinance, an assessee as defined in section 2(6) o f the repealed Ordinance was alien to the provisions of s ection 122, hence the same did not apply to an assessee within the contemplation of the repealed Ordinance, particular ly so when the two terms, ‘taxpayer’ and ‘assessee’ were not interchangeable.

[112] Thus, the relevant provisions did not have retrospective effect. CA 778-2005 ETC 37 27. Mr. Muhammad Shoaib Abbasi, ASC for the respon dents in C.A. 115- submitted that his case was cover ed by section 122(5A) and the relevant provisions could not be gi ven retrospective effect. He adopted the arguments of Mr.

[113] Shahbaz Butt. 28. Mr. Izharul Haq Siddiqui, ASC for the responde nts in C.A. No.475- adopted the arguments advanced on b ehalf of the respondents. 29. Mr. Hamid Shabbir Azar, ASC for the respondent in C.A. No. submitted that his case was covered by section 122(5A). He adopted the arguments of the learned counsel for th e respondents. 30.

[114] Mr. Irfan Ahmed Sheikh, ASC for the respondent in C.A. No. 923- submitted that the definition of asses sment included re- assessment under section 2(5) read with section 239 (1) & (2) and its application could not be attracted to the cases in which assessments had already been finalized. 31. Mr. Hakam Qureshi, ASC learned counsel for the respondent in C.A.

[115] No.  adopted the arguments of Mr. Muhammad Iqbal Hashmi. He stated that when there were two or more interpretations, then in fiscal laws, the Court would adopt the interpret ation favouring the taxpayer. 32. The learned Attorney General for Pakistan appe ared on behalf of the Federal Government and filed concise stateme nt.

[116] He stated that there would be no governance system at all in the c ountry if the incomes were not properly assessed and the taxes not collec ted, causing prejudice to the public revenues. He argued as under: - (1) No vested rights had accrued to the assessees i n the matter of reopening, revising or amending of their assessm ents of the CA 778-2005 ETC 38 pre-2001 Ordinance period as nobody could be allowe d to gain premium on his mala fide acts, such as incorrect or collusive assessments, concealed income, etc; (2) The impugned provisions were meant to modify th e charge of tax offered by a taxpayer/assessee to actual tax ch argeable and payable and to crystallize the correct charge a s per the charging sections where there was mistake or error, or evasion, mis-declaration, tax fraud, or wrong appli cation of law resulting in inaccurate charge of tax made, in the return of income; (3) It was not a new concept, but was there in the Income Tax Act 1922 (sections 34 & 34A) as well as in the repealed Ordinance (sections 65 & 66A) and was now on the statute book in the form of section 122 of the Ordinance; (4) Correction of assessment in favour of the taxpa yer through rectification, appeal or revision was provided in s ections 221, 127, 122A of the Ordinance.

[117] However, as no right of appeal was provided to the revenue department against an e rroneous order of the tax authority, though the taxpayer had such right, errors of judgment operating against the revenue de partment would continue without remedy if provision like sec tion 122 were not introduced; (5) Subsections (5), (5A) and (9) laid down the par ameters within which such powers would be exercised.

[118] Subsections ( 2), (4), (4A) and (5B) provided time limits and subsection ( 8) restricted the meaning of “definite information”, a s used in sub-section (5) ibid . Thus, the legislature did not cast any additional burden, any new charge or duty on the su bject, it merely clarified that amendment could be made on fu lfillment of twin conditions of erroneousness and prejudice t o the revenue; (6) Similar provisions on amending the duty and tax es assessment were also available in the Customs Act ( S.32) and the Sales Tax Act 1990 (Section 36).

[119] If a “pers on” paid tax with the return of income based on proper computati on of total income, and proper application of tax rate; there i s then no CA 778-2005 ETC 39 issue as no appeal, no amendment, and no correction will be needed, as it would be accurate charge of tax; (7) Subsections (5) and (5A) of section 122 were no n-charging sections and were procedural in nature, therefore, the same were retrospective in operation; (8) These provisions were also to be read in conjun ction with section 122(1) which provided explicitly amendment of assessment already finalized under the repealed Ord inance; and (9) The provisions of subsections (5) or (5A) were not pari materia to sections 65 or 66A of the repealed Ordinance, th ough certain conditions were transported into the said s ubsections.

[120] But, in any case, the two sets of provisions were d ifferent, inasmuch as the IAC could cancel or annul an assess ment under section 66A, but the Commissioner could not p ass such an order under subsection (5A); (10) The application of the tax rate was protected under section 239(1) of the Ordinance, and same tax rate was appl icable in respect of the assessments amended under the provis ions of section 122; (11) The case law on the issue of retrospectivity r eferred to by the learned counsel for the respondents was not relevan t. 33.

[121] We have heard the learned Attorney General for Pakistan and the learned counsel for the parties and have gone t hrough the relevant case law cited by them at the bar. 34. It may be observed that the Ordinance is the t hird major enactment governing the taxation laws. It was prece ded by the Income Tax Ordinance, 1979, repealed on the enforcement of the Ordinance on 1.7.2002, and the Income Tax Act, 1922, one of laws adapted under the Indian Independence Act, 1947 on the eve of creatio n of Pakistan, which in turn was repealed by the Ordinance of 1979.

[122] The Pre amble to the Ordinance states that it is expedient to consolidat e and amend the law CA 778-2005 ETC 40 relating to income tax and to provide for matters a ncillary thereto or connected therewith. The decision of these appeals turns mainly on the true construction of section 122 of the Ordinance.

[123] We, therefore, undertake a brief survey of the legislative process, through which the provisions of this section have passed in taking their present sh ape and form, insofar the same is relevant for the purposes of adjudicati on of the controversy raised in these appeals. Section 122, as incorporat ed in the Income Tax Ordinance, 2001 (Ordinance No.

[124] XLIX of 2001) provid ed as under: - “122. Amendment of assessments.- (1) Subject to this section, the Commissioner may amend an assessment order treated as issued under section 120 or issued under section 121 by making such alterations or additions as the Commissioner consid ers necessary to ensure that the taxpayer is liable for the correct amount of tax for the tax year to which the assessment order relates. (2) An assessment order shall only be amended unde r subsection (1) within five years after the Commissioner has is sued or is treated as having issued the assessment order on the taxpay er. (3) Where a taxpayer furnishes a revised return un der subsection (6) of section 114 - (a) the Commissioner shall be treated as having ma de an amended assessment of the taxable income and tax payable thereon as set out in the revised return; a nd (b) the taxpayer’s revised return shall be taken f or all purposes of this Ordinance to be an amended assessment order issued to the taxpayer by the Commissioner on the day on which the revised return was furnished. (4) Where an assessment order (hereinafter referre d to as the “original assessment”) has been amended under subse ction (1) or (3), the Commissioner may further amend, the origin al assessment within the later of – (a) five years after the Commissioner has issued o r is treated as having issued the original assessment or der to the taxpayer; or (b) one year after the Commissioner has issued or i s treated as having issued the amended assessment order to the taxpayer.

[125] CA 778-2005 ETC 41 (5) An assessment order shall only be amended unde r subsection (1) and an amended assessment for that year shall o nly be further amended under subsection (4) where the Commissioner – (a) is of the view that this Ordinance has been incorr ectly applied in making the assessment (including the misclassification of an amount under a head of inco me to claim tax relief, an incorrect claim for exempti on of any amount or an incorrect claim for a refund; or (b) has definite information acquired from an audit or otherwise that the assessment is incorrect. (6) As soon as possible after making an amended ass essment under subsection (1) or (4), the Commissioner shall issue an amended assessment order to the taxpayer stating – (a) the amended taxable income of the taxpayer; (b) the amended amount of tax due; (c) the amount of tax paid, if any; and (d) the time, place, and manner of appealing the a mended assessment. (7) An amended assessment order shall be treated i n all respects as an assessment order for the purposes of this Ord inance, other than for the purposes of subsection (1). (8) For the purposes of this section, “definite in formation” includes information on sales or purchases of any goods made by the taxpayer, and on the acquisition, possession or dis posal of any money, asset, valuable article or investment made o r expenditure incurred by the taxpayer.

[126] In pursuance of section 1(3) of the Ordinance, it c ame into force w.e.f. 1.7.2002. By the Finance Ordinance 1, 2002, enacted simultaneously with effect from the same date, i.e. the date of enforce ment of the Ordinance, the following amendments 2 were made in section 122: - In subsection (1), the words and figures “or issued under section 59, 59A, 62, 63 or 65 of the repealed Ordin ance, were inserted. 1 Printed as “Act” in the Income Tax Manual publishe d by the Federal Board of Revenue.

[127] The National Assembly was not in existence at the relevant time, so no Act could be passed. 2 Large scale amendments were made in the Ordinance overall. CA 778-2005 ETC 42 [The Commissioner’s power to amend an assessment wa s also made applicable to the assessments orders passed un der certain sections of the repealed Ordinance.] Words “as many times as may be necessary” were inse rted in subsection (4) [The scope of power of amendment of assessments mad e under subsection (1) or (3) was enlarged.] 35.

[128] By SRO No.633(I) /2002 dated 14.9.2002, the fo llowing new subsection (4A) was inserted into section 122: - “An amended assessment shall only be made within si x years of the date of original assessment. [Six years’ time-limit from the date of the origina l assessment was provided for an amended assessment, by which expres sion it appears that the original assessment could be amend ed by the Commissioner within a period of six years] In subsection (5), in clause (a), after the word “O rdinance”, the words “or the repealed Ordinance” were inserted. [Thus, the assessments of pre-2001 Ordinance period were included.] In subsection (5), in clause (b), for the words “as sessment is incorrect” the words “income has been concealed or inaccurate particulars of income have been furnishe d or the assessment is otherwise incorrect” were substituted . [The scope of amendment of assessment was stated.] After subsection (5), new subsection (5A) was also inserted into section 122: - “5(A) Where a person does not produce accounts and records, or details of expenditure, assets and liab ilities or any other information required for the purposes of audi t under section 177, or does not file wealth statement unde r section 116, the Commissioner may, based on any available information and to the best of Commissioner’s judgm ent; make an amended assessment.” CA 778-2005 ETC 43 [Certain eventualities were provided where the Comm issioner may pass an amended assessment order.] In pursuance of the judgment of this Court in the c ase of Kashmir Edible Oils Lt d3 (supra), the aforesaid SRO was rescinded by SRO No .608 (I) /2003 dated 24.6.2003 with which the amendments mad e in the Ordinance stood withdrawn. 36.

[129] The Ordinance was next amended by the Finance Act, 2003.The amendments introduced in section 122 are a s under: - The words “to ensure that the taxpayer is liable fo r correct amount of tax for the tax year to which the assessm ent order relates” were omitted from subsection (1). New subsection (4A) was inserted as under: - “(4A) In respect of an assessment made under the r epealed Ordinance, nothing contained in subsection (2) or, as the case may be, subsection (4) shall be so construed as to have extended or curtailed the time-limit specified in s ection 65 of the aforesaid Ordinance in respect of an assessment order passed under that section and the time-limit specif ied in that section shall apply accordingly. [The time-limit already provided in section 65 of t he repealed Ordinance was incorporated into the statute with re spect to the assessment orders passed under that section.

[130] In fac t, the amendment earlier brought about by the SRO dated 14 .9.2002 was reincorporated with a change in the time-limit] Subsection (5) was substituted as follows: - “(5) An assessment order in respect of tax year, o r an assessment year, shall only be amended under sub-se ction (1) and an amended assessment for that year shall o nly be further amended under sub-section (4) where, on the basis of definite information acquired from an audit or othe rwise, the Commissioner is satisfied that – 3 Discussed in later part of the judgment to see its effect on the issues involved in these appeals.

[131] CA 778-2005 ETC 44 (i) any income chargeable to tax has escaped assessment; or (ii) total income has been under-assessed, or assessed at too low a rate, or has been the subject of excessive relief or refund; or (iii) any amount under a head of income has been misclassified.” [A part of the provisions of section 65 of the repe aled Ordinance, earlier not included in the Ordinance, was brought on the statute book in the form of this subsection, that is to say , the grounds for additional assessment given in that section, were e nacted here.

[132] To this extent, the provisions of section 65 and subse ction (5) are pari materia .] New subsection (5A) was inserted as under: - “(5A) Subject to sub-section (9), the Commissioner may amend, or further amend, an assessment order, if he considers that the assessment order is erroneous in so far it is prejudicial to the interest of revenue.” [The Commissioner was empowered to amend or further amend an assessment on two other considerations, namely, the erroneousness of an assessment, or its being prejud icial to the interest of revenue.

[133] An assessment earlier amended under section 65 of the repealed Ordinance was also made liable t o be amended or further amended under this subsection. While exe rcising power under this subsection, taxpayer was to be provided with an opportunity of hearing as provided in subsection (9 ) To the extent of the grounds provided under this subsection for amen ding or further amending an assessment, this subsection is pari materia with section 66A of the repealed Ordinance.] New subsection (5B) was inserted as under: - “(5B) Any amended assessment order under sub-sectio n (5A) may be passed within the time-limit specified in su b-section (2) or sub-section (4), as the case may be.” [Time-limits provided earlier were made applicable to amendment of assessments to be made under subsection (5A).] CA 778-2005 ETC 45 Words and figures “subsection (1), subsection (4) o r subsection (5A)” were added in subsection (6). [The amended assessment order in terms of subsectio n (6) was to be issued in three categories, namely, amended asse ssment order passed under subsections (1), (4), or (5A).

[134] Amended assessments orders passed under subsection (3) would not be req uired to be issued in terms of subsection (6) ] In subsection (8), the words, “ receipts of the taxpayer from services rendered or any other receipts that may be chargeab le to tax under this Ordinance ” were added. Thus, the phrase “definite informatio n” was further elaborated. 37.

[135] A perusal of the overall provisions of section 122, as amended from time to time, shows that the Commissioner is e mpowered to amend an assessment order by making such alterations or a dditions as he considers necessary. The power of amendment is to b e exercised in the manner provided in section 122, which stipulates ce rtain restrictions on the exercise of such power.

[136] The power of amendment can be exercised in respect of an assessment order treated as issued un der section 120 or issued under section 121, or issued under section 5 9, 59A, 62, 63 or 65 of the repealed Ordinance. The assessment order can be amended within five years after the Commissioner has issued or is treated as having issued the assessment order on the taxpayer while a n amended assessment order can be amended or further amended within a period of one year after the Commissioner has issued or is tr eated as having issued the amended assessment order to the taxpayer.

[137] The t ime limit provided in section 65 of the repealed Ordinance would be avail able in respect of an assessment order passed under that section. Under s ubsection (5), an CA 778-2005 ETC 46 assessment shall only be amended, or an amended ass essment shall only be further amended on the basis of definite informa tion acquired from an audit or otherwise, where the Commissioner is satis fied that any income chargeable to tax has escaped assessment, or total income has been under-assessed, or assessed at too low a rate, or h as been the subject of excessive relief or refund, or any amount under a h ead of income has been misclassified.

[138] So, there has to be definite in formation with the Commissioner, e.g. information on sales or purchase s of any goods made by the taxpayer, receipts of the taxpayer from serv ices rendered or any other receipts that may be chargeable to tax under the Ordinance and on the acquisition, possession or disposal of any mone y, asset, valuable article or investment made or expenditure incurred by the taxpayer.

[139] Such information must have been received from a certain source. Such information must stipulate a case of escaped assess ment, under- assessment, assessment at too low a rate, excessive relief or refund, or misclassification of a head of income. Subsection ( 5A) also empowers the Commissioner to amend, or further amend an assessme nt order if he considers that the assessment order is erroneous in so far it is prejudicial to the interest of revenue, but before doing that, he shall provide the taxpayer with an opportunity of being heard.

[140] Power to amend or further amend an assessment order is also subject to the ti me-limit of five years or one year. 38. At this stage, it is necessary to have a glanc e at the provisions of section 239, the savings clause of the Ordinance because in the context of transition to a new phase of law, particularly w here an existing law is repealed, the savings clause is always of pivotal n ature, inasmuch as it CA 778-2005 ETC 47 serves as a bridge to make the transition smooth.

[141] S ubsections (1), (2) and (3) of section 239, as originally enacted, provided as under: - “(1) The repealed Ordinance 1979 shall continue to apply to the assessment year ending on the 30 th day of June 2003. (2) In making any assessment in respect of any inco me year ending on or before the 30 th day of June 2002, the provisions of the repealed Ordinance relating to the computation of total income and the tax payable thereon shall apply as if this Ordinance had not come into force. (3) Where any return of income has been furnished by a person for any assessment year ending on or before the 30 th day of June 2003, proceedings for the assessment of the pe rson for that year shall be taken and continued as if this Ordina nce has not come into force. “ The above subsections were amended by the Finance O rdinance, 2002 as under:- “(1) Subject to subsection (2), in making any asse ssment in respect of any income year ending on or before the 30 th day of June, 2002, the provisions of the repealed Ordinance in s o far as these relate to computation of total income and tax payab le thereon shall apply as if this Ordinance had not come into force. (2) The assessment, referred to in subsection (1), shall be made by an income tax authority which is competent under this Ordinance to make an assessment in respect of a tax year ending on any date after the 30 th day of June, 2002, and in accordance with the procedure specified in section 59 or 59A or 61 or 62 or 63, as the case may be, of the repealed Ordinance. (3) The provisions of subsections (1) and (2) shal l apply, in like manner, to the imposition or charge of any pen alty, additional tax or any other amount, under the repealed Ordinan ce, as these apply to the assessment, so however that procedure for such imposition or charge shall be in accordance with th e corresponding provisions of this Ordinance.” CA 778-2005 ETC 48 Thus, as per original subsection (1) of section 239 – (i) The repealed Ordinance was applicable to assess ment year ending on 30 th June, 2003; (ii) The repealed Ordinance governed the computatio n of total income and the tax payable thereon in respect of an y income year ending on or before the 30 th day of June 2002; and (iii) The repealed Ordinance was applicable to proc eedings in respect of assessment for the year ending on or bef ore the 30 th day of June 2003.

[142] After the aforesaid amendment brought about by the Finance Ordinance, 2002, the authority competent to make an assessment in respect of a tax year ending on or before the 30 th day of June, 2002 under the Ordinance was empowered to make an assessment in respect of a tax year ending on any date after the 30 th day of June, 2002, in accordance with the procedure specified in sections 59, 59A, 61, 62 or 63 of the repealed Ordinance.

[143] The imposition or charge of any penalty, additional tax or any other amount, under the repealed Ordinance would al so be governed by the aforesaid provisions. In subsection (2) of sect ion 239, assessments under sections 59, 59A, 62 or 63 were referred to [ whereas in subsection (1) of section 122, apart from the assessments unde r sections 59, 59A, 62 or 63, assessment under section 65 of the repealed Ordinance was also included.] 39.

[144] According to the learned counsel for the respo ndents, the previous laws envisaged additional assessment where any income chargeable to tax had escaped assessment, or was un der assessed, or assessed at too low a rate, or was the subject of e xcessive relief (section 34 of the Income Tax Act, 1922 and section 65 of th e repealed Ordinance).

[145] It was contended that the provisions of subsection (5) of section 122 in CA 778-2005 ETC 49 particular were pari materia with the provisions of section 65 of the repealed Ordinance to that extent, and the legislat ure being aware of the previous state of the law, consciously did not enac t a similar provision in section 122(1) as originally enacted and also omitt ed to save section 65.

[146] Therefore, subsequent reference to that section, or for that matter, the other sections of the repealed Ordinance, in sectio n 122(1) was of little significance. They vehemently contended that sectio n 65 having not been saved, the provisions of section 122(1), and partic ularly the provisions of subsections (5) and (5A) could not be applied retro spectively so as to reopen, revise or amend the assessments finalized u nder the repealed Ordinance.

[147] On the other hand, the learned counsel f or the appellants stated that lacuna, if any, in the savings clause s tood cured with the amendment of subsection (1) of section 122 and intr oduction of subsection (5). 40. We have given our anxious consideration to thi s aspect of the matter. To facilitate an easy analysis, the three p rovisions are juxtaposed with the help of the following comparative chart: - COMPARATIVE CHART OF CORRESPONDING PROVISIONS Income Tax Act, 1922 Section 34 Income Tax Ordinance, 1979 Section 65 Income Tax Ordinance 2001 Section 122 34.

[148] Income escaping assessment: If for any reason income, profits or gains chargeable to income-tax have escaped assessment in any year or have been assessed at too low a rate, or have been 65. Additional assessment.- (1) If, in any year, for any reason,- (a) any income chargeable to tax under this Ordinance has escaped assessment; or (b) the total income of an assessee has been under assessed, or assessed at too low a rate, or has been the 122.

[149] Amendment of assessments.- (1) Subject to this section, the Commissioner may amend an assessment order treated as issued under section 120 or issued under section 121, or issued under section 59, 59A, 62, 63 or 65 of the repealed Ordinance, by making such alterations or additions as the Commissioner considers necessary. (2) An assessment order shall only be amended under subsection (1) within five years after the Commissioner has issued or is treated as having issued the assessment order on the taxpayer.

[150] CA 778-2005 ETC 50 the subject of excessive relief or refund under this Act, the Income-tax Officer may, at any time within one year of the end of that year, serve on the person liable to pay tax on such income, profits, or gains, or in the case of a company, on the principal officer thereof, a notice containing all or any of the requirements which may be included in a notice under sub-section (2) of section 22 and may proceed to assess or reassess such income, profits or gains, and the provisions of this Act, shall, so far as may be, apply accordingly as if the notice were a notice issued under that sub- section: Provided that the tax shall be charged at the rate at which it would have been charged had the income, profits or gains not escaped assessment or full assessment, as the case may be: Provided further that subject of excessive relief or refund under this ordinance; or (c) the total income of an assessee and the tax payable by him has been assessed or determined under sub- section (1) of section 59 or section 59A or deemed to have been so assessed or determined under sub- section (1) of section 59 or section 59A, the Deputy Commissioner may, at any time, subject to the provisions of sub- sections(2), (3) and (4), issue a notice to the assessee containing all or any of the requirements of a notice under section 56 and may proceed to assess or determine, by an order in writing, the total income of the assessee or the tax payable by him, as the case may be, and all the provisions of this Ordinance shall, so far as may be, apply accordingly: Provided that the tax shall be charged at the rate or rates applicable to the assessment year for which the assessment is made. (2) No proceedings under sub-section (1) shall be initiated unless definite information has come into the possession of the Deputy Commissioner and he has obtained the previous approval of the Inspecting Additional Commissioner of Income Tax in writing to do so.

[151] Explanation.- As used in this sub-section, "definite information" (3) Where a taxpayer furnishes a revised return under sub-section (6) of section 114 - (a) the Commissioner shall be treated as having made an amended assessment of the taxable income and tax payable thereon as set out in the revised return; and (b) the taxpayer’s revised return shall be taken for all purposes of this Ordinance to be an amended assessment order issued to the taxpayer by the Commissioner on the day on which the revised return was furnished. (4) Where an assessment order (hereinafter referred to as the “original assessment”) has been amended under sub- section (1) or (3), the Commissioner may further amend,1[as many times as may be necessary, the original assessment within the later of – (a) five years after the Commissioner has issued or is treated as having issued the original assessment order to the taxpayer; or (b) one year after the Commissioner has issued or is treated as having issued the amended assessment order to the taxpayer. (4A) In respect of an assessment made under the repealed Ordinance, nothing contained in sub-section (2) or, as the case may be, sub-section (4) shall be so construed as to have extended or curtailed the time limit specified in section 65 of the aforesaid Ordinance in respect of an assessment order passed under that section and the time-limit specified in that section shall apply accordingly. (5) An assessment order in respect of tax year, or an assessment year, shall only be amended under sub-section (1) and an amended assessment for that year shall only be further amended under sub-section (4) where, on the basis of definite information acquired from an audit or otherwise, the Commissioner is satisfied that– (i) any income chargeable to tax has escaped assessment; or (ii) total income has been under- assessed, or assessed at too low a rate, or has been the subject of excessive relief or refund; or (iii) any amount under a head of income has been misclassified.] (5A) Subject to sub-section (9), the Commissioner may amend, or further amend, an assessment order, if he considers that the assessment order is erroneous in so far it is prejudicial to the interest of revenue.

[152] CA 778-2005 ETC 51 where the assessment made or to be made is an assessment made or to be made on a person deemed to be the agent of a non-resident person under section 43, no notice under this subsection shall be issued after the expiry of one year of the end of that year. Provided further that unless definite information has come into his possession, the Income-tax Officer shall not initiate proceedings under this subsection without obtaining the previous approval of the Inspecting Assistant Commissioner of Income-tax in writing. includes information in respect of sales and purchases, made by the assessee, of any goods, and any information regarding acquisition, possession or transfer, by the assessee, of any money, asset or valuable article, or any investment made or expenditure incurred by him. (3) Notice under sub- section (1), in respect of any income year, may be issued within ten years from the end of the assessment year in which the total income of the said income year was first assessable: Provided that, where the said notice is issued on or after the first day of July, 1987, this sub-section shall have effect as if for the words "ten years" the words "five years" were substituted. (3A) Where a notice under sub-section (1) is issued on or after the first day of July, 1982, no order under the said sub-section shall be made after the expiration of one year from the end of the financial year in which such notice was served. (5B) Any amended assessment order under sub-section (5A) may be passed within the time-limit specified in sub-section (2) or sub- section (4), as the case may be. (6) As soon as possible after making an amended assessment under sub-section (1), sub-section (4) or sub-section (5A), the Commissioner shall issue an amended assessment order to the taxpayer stating – (a) the amended taxable income of the taxpayer; (b) the amended amount of tax due; (c) the amount of tax paid, if any; and (d) the time, place, and manner of appealing the amended assessment. (7) An amended assessment order shall be treated in all respects as an assessment order for the purposes of this Ordinance, other than for the purposes of sub-section (1). (8) For the purposes of this section, “definite information” includes information on sales or purchases of any goods made by the taxpayer, receipts of the taxpayer from services rendered or any other receipts that may be chargeable to tax under this Ordinance,] and on the acquisition, possession or disposal of any money, asset, valuable article or investment made or expenditure incurred by the taxpayer. (9) No assessment shall be amended, or further amended, under this section unless the taxpayer has been provided with an opportunity of being heard.” 41.

[153] There is force in the contention of the learne d counsel for the respondents that the concept of additional assessme nt on the ground of escaped income, etc., as prevalent under the repeal ed Ordinance, or previously under the Income Tax Act, 1922, and also available in other jurisdictions (e.g. section 147 of the Indian Incom e Tax Act, 1961), was not legislated under the Ordinance as originally framed and promulgated.

[154] It CA 778-2005 ETC 52 appears that the Ordinance was drafted in post haste and the draftsman omitted to incorporate this important provision. Th is observation is supported from the fact that the Ordinance was subj ected to speedy, successive and large scale amendments, particularly at its very inception.

[155] It may be seen that section 238 provided that the O rdinance shall come into force on a date to be appointed by the Federal Government by notification in the official gazette. Accordingly, vide notification (SRO No. 381(I)/2002) dated 16.6.2002, the Ordinance came in to force with effect from the first day of July 2002, but with more or less 1000 amendments inserted by the Finance Ordinance, 2002 , as calculated by the learned counsel for the respondents.

[156] Soon thereafter, the F ederal Government, in the purported exercise of power under section 240, a provision meant for removal of difficulties, came up with SRO No. 633(I )/2002 dated 14.9.2002, whereby amendments of substantive nature were made in different provisions of the Ordinance, e.g. section s 114, 121, 122, 137, 141, 161, 221 & 239, which changed the entire compl exion of the law.

[157] The SRO also provided that for making any assessment fo r the year beginning on the first day of July, 2002, or making any deduc tion or collection of tax for the year beginning on the last day of July, 200 2, the Ordinance would have effect accordingly. 42. The validity of the aforesaid SRO was called i n question in various writ petitions filed before the Lahore High Court.

[158] A learned Single Judge of that Court allowed the writ petitions and declared the SRO in question ultra vires the Ordinance. The matter came up for consideratio n before this Court in the case of Kashmir Edible Oils Ltd (supra). This Court held that merely because the Federal Government was vested with the power to remove the difficulties in giving effect t o any of the provisions of CA 778-2005 ETC 53 the Ordinance did not empower the Government to go ahead with making amendments or repealing the provisions of the Ordin ance.

[159] It was held that section 240 of the Ordinance had placed an embargo that the order passed by the Federal Government for removal of dif ficulties would not be inconsistent with the provisions of the Ordinance. Therefore, the Federal Government exceeded its powers of delegated legisla tion as contemplated by section 240 of the Ordinance and thus the said S RO could not co-exist with the original provisions of the Ordinance, many of which were sought to be amended thereby.

[160] However, it was observed that s ince the question of validity and effect of amendment in section 122 of the Ordinance by the Finance Act No. 1 of 2003 was not directly involved , therefore, the same was not examined in those proceedings .4 It is noteworthy that retrospectivity or otherwise of the provisions of s ection 122 remained undetermined by this Court in Kashmir Edible Oils Ltd. ( supra ).

[161] The effect of the above decision of this Court on the cases pe nding either before this Court, or before any other authority or Court would be that the proceedings initiated in pursuance of the amendments of the SRO period, i.e. 14.9.2002 to 30.6.2003 would abate, inasmuch the very provisi ons of the Ordinance under which the proceedings were initiated were dec lared ultra vires and rendered null and void ab initio .

[162] However, the proceedings initiated on the basis of the provisions of the Ordinance, as amende d from time to time, minus the provisions of the SRO period , would be in the field and subject to the decision of these appeals. This consideratio n in view, the learned counsel for the appellants frankly conceded that th e appeals relating to the SRO period were not competent.

[163] They, therefore, req uested that C.As. No. 1617, 1622-1624, 2673 & 2675-2678 of 2006, and C.As . No. 497, 498, 4 Emphasis supplied. CA 778-2005 ETC 54 911, 916, 1002, 1003, & 2282–2292 of 2008 may be al lowed to be withdrawn. Accordingly, these appeals are dismissed as withdrawn. 43. At this juncture, we advert to the questions w hether section 122 of the Ordinance is a procedural or substantive provision, whether it is to be applied prospectively or retrospectively, and whether assessees or taxpayers have acquired any right that their assess ments finalized under the repealed Ordinance, being past and closed trans actions, shall not be opened or amended under this provision?

[164] The learned counsel for the parties hotly contested the issue, the learned Atto rney General for Pakistan on behalf of the Federal Government suppor ting the stance of the appellants that the provisions of the section were machinery provisions and not substantive as no tax or charge was levied thereby, therefore, the same were retrospective in operation and being proc edural in nature applied to the assessments orders passed under the repealed Ordinance, moreso as the assessees had no vested right in the matter of reopening of the previous assessments.

[165] To resolve these issues, we revert to the case- law cited at the bar, but would suffice to refer to only some of them in the paragraphs next following. 44. In the case of Adnan Afzal v. Capt. Sher Afzal (PLD 1969 SC 187) the issue before this Court was the applicabil ity of the West Pakistan Family Courts Act, 1964 to the proceedings commence d before the Act came into force.

[166] In holding that the Act brought ab out only procedural changes and did not affect any substantive right, t herefore, according to the general rule of interpretation, that a procedur al statute was to be given retroactive effect unless the law contained a contr ary indication, Hamoodur Rehman, C.J., speaking for the Court, dilated upon the issue as under: - CA 778-2005 ETC 55 “The general principle with regard to the interpret ation of statutes as laid down in the well known case of the Colonial Sugar Refining Company Limited v.

[167] Irving (1905 A C 369) is that "if the matter in question be a matter of procedure only", the provisions would be retrospective. "On the other hand, if it be more than a matter of procedur e, if it touches a right in existence at the passing of the Act", then "in acco rdance with a long line of authorities extending from the time of Lord Coke to the present day", the legislation would not operate retrospectively, unless the Legislature had either "by express enactment or by necessary in tendment" given the legislation retroactive effect.

[168] To the same effect are the observations of Jessel, master of the Rolls, in the case of In re: Joseph Suche & Co. Limited ((1875) 1 Ch. D. 48), where it was observed that as "a general rule when the Le gislature alters the rights of parties by taking away or conferring any right of action, its enactments, unless in express terms they apply to p ending actions, do not affect them.

[169] It is said that there is on exception to that rule, namely, that these enactments merely affect procedure and do not extend to rights of action, they have been held to apply to existing ri ghts." The question for consideration there was regarding the right of a secured creditor of a company to prove for the full amount of his debt without deducting the value of his securities in the course of the winding up.

[170] That was held to be, in substance, a right of action for the recovery of a debt and, therefore, section 10 of the English Judicatur e Act was held not to apply retrospectively. The principle has been admirably put by Crawford in his Book on Construction of Statutes, 1940 Edition, page 581, a s follows :- “As a general rule, legislation which relates solel y to procedure or to legal remedies will not be subject to the rule t hat statutes should not be given retroactive operation.

[171] Similarly, the presumption against retrospective construction is inapplicable. In other words, such statutes constitute an exception to the rule p ertaining to statutes generally. Therefore, in the absence of a contrary legislative intention, statutes pertaining solely t o procedure or legal remedy may affect a right of action no matter wheth er it came into existence prior to, or after the enactment of the s tatute.

[172] Similarly, they may be held applicable to proceedings pending or subsequently commenced. In any event, they will, at least, presumptively apply to accrued and pending as well as to future actions.” In this judgment, the Court also considered the que stion as to what were matters of procedure and held as under: - “The next question, therefore, that arises for cons ideration is as to what are matters of procedure.

[173] It is obvious that m atters relating to the remedy, the mode of trial, the manner of taking evidence and forms of action are all matters relating to procedu re. Crawford too takes the view that questions relating to jurisdict ion over a cause of action, venue, parties pleadings and rules of evide nce also pertain to procedure, provided the burden of proof is not s hifted.

[174] Thus a statute purporting to transfer jurisdiction over ce rtain causes of action may operate retroactively. This is what is m eant by saying CA 778-2005 ETC 56 that a change of forum by a law is retrospective be ing a matter of procedure only. Nevertheless, it must be pointed ou t that if in this process any existing rights are affected or the giv ing of retroactive operation causes inconvenience or injustice, then t he Courts will not even in the case of a procedural statute, favour an interpretation giving retrospective effect to the statute.

[175] On the other hand, if the new procedural statute is of such a character that its retroactive application will tend to promote justice without an y consequential embarrassment or detriment to any of the parties co ncerned, the Courts would favorably incline towards giving effec t to such procedural statutes retroactively.” 45.

[176] In a subsequent judgment of this Court reporte d as Nabi Ahmed v. Home Secretary (PLD 1969 SC 599) where the case of Adnan Afzal (supra) was also relied upon, the issue of retrosp ectivity was examined at still greater length. It is pertinent t o refer to the following paragraphs from the said judgment:- “21.

[177] In England, the basic sentiment of revulsion a gainst injustice is strengthened by the jealousy of Courts to preserve their jurisdiction uncontaminated by extra-judicial considerations. Th ey regard all considerations, whether political, administrative o r even legislative, if they are not embodied in the law itself, as subordi nate, if not entirely extraneous, to the judicial outlook.

[178] In the United States of America, emphasis on the constitutional separation of power is added. In the words of the American Jurisprudence, 16th Volume, p age 771, Art. 429: "The position has been taken, however, in some juri sdictions that when an action is once commenced, jurisdiction is purely a judicial question, and it is unconstitutional, un der the doctrine of the separation of the powers of Governm ent, for the Legislature to attempt to usurp the judicial fu nction by interfering legislation to oust the jurisdiction of the Court." ------------------------------ 22.

[179] One more consideration which appeals to me is that law abiding members of society regulate their lives acc ording to the law as it exists at the time of their actions, and they expect the law to be steadfast and reliable See Hughes and others v. Lumley and others ((1854) 4 E & B 358). They assess and weigh the con sequences according to the demands of existing law, including the requirements implicit in the existing system of law, and are ent itled to feel, cheated if the law later lets them down by taking away or r educing their rights, or increasing their burdens.

[180] As pointed out by Willes, J. in Phillips v. Eyre (22 L T 869) at p. 876 "Retrospective laws are no doubt prima facie of questionable policy, and contrary to the general principle that legislation by CA 778-2005 ETC 57 which the conduct of mankind is to be regulated oug ht, when introduced for the first time, to deal with future acts, and ought not to change the character of past transactions ca rried on upon the faith of the then existing law." Further: "Blackstone, J., 1 Com. 46, describes laws ex post facto of this objectionable class as those by which after an action indifferent in itself is committed, the Legislature then for the first time declares it to have been a crime, and in flicts a punishment upon the person who has committed it.

[181] He re it is impossible that the party could foresee that an act ion, innocent when it was done, should be afterwards con verted to guilt by a subsequent law; he had, therefore, no ca use to abstain from it, and all punishment for not abstain ing must of consequence be cruel and unjust'." 23. Justice Holmes of America has emphasized that l aw should be reliably ascertainable-this is important for law ab iding persons, so that they may arrange their lives accordingly, but it is equally, if not more, important for wrong-doers in order to know th eir chances in law.

[182] The learned Judge has said in his address deli vered in 1897 that- " . . if we take the view of our friend the bad man , we shall find that he does not care two straws for the axioms of deductions, but that he does want to know what the Massachusett s or English Courts are likely to do in fact. I am much of his mind.

[183] The prophecies of what the Courts will do in fact, and nothing more pretentious, are what I mean by the law." What the Courts will do tomorrow depends a great de al on the answer to the question: To whom the appeal lies. Th is is why, to my mind, the Privy Council held in Colonial Sugar Co., that there was no difference between changing the forum of an appeal and altogether abolishing it.

[184] A past and closed transaction must b e taken to have been concluded according to the law in force at tha t time, and the ultimate legal consequences of a legal duty or a le gal right arising there from must, according to Justice Holmes, mean to the parties to it, "a prophecy". Civilization is in justice bound to respect that ‘prophecy', because the need for such prophecy is a creation of a civilized society. 24.

[185] People do not mind changes in law, if only the procedure is altered without altering the substance of the law. True, it is not easy to draw a line between substantive and procedural l aw, but the task is not impossible if the essential difference is ke pt in mind. According to Salmond’s Jurisprudence, 12th Edition of 1966 at page 128- "The law of procedure may be defined as that branch of the law which governs the process of litigation . . . . .

[186] All the residue is substantive law, and relates, not to the process of litigation, but to its purposes and subject-matter. " CA 778-2005 ETC 58 Thus: " .. a right of appeal, a right to give evidence on one's own behalf, a right to interrogate the other party,' 'r ules defining the remedy . . . . as those which define the right itse lf,' that part of criminal law which deals, not with crimes alone, bu t with punishments also, as the measure of liability and m any rules of procedure which, in their practical operation, a re wholly or substantially equivalent to rules of substantive la w," and, as such must be treated as falling within the classification of substantive law.

[187] In this category has been included by this Court the change of forum- "If in the process any existing rights are affected or the giving of retroactive operation causes inconvenience or in justice." The rule regarding retrospectivity of statutes, as stated in Halsbury’s Laws of England, Vol. 36, 3 rd Edition, at pp. 423 & 426 runs as under: - “The general rule is that all statutes, other than those which are merely declaratory, or which relate only to matters of procedure or of evidence, are prima facie , prospective, and retrospective effect is not to be given to them unless, by express words or necessary implication, it appears that this was the intention of the Legislature.” “The presumption against retrospection does not app ly to legislation concerned merely with matters of procedure or of ev idence; on the contrary, provisions of that nature are to be const rued as retrospective unless there is a clear indication th at such was not the intention of the Parliament. “It is presumed, moreover, that procedural statutes are intended to be fully retrospective in their operation, that is to say, are intended to apply not merely to future actions in respect of ex isting causes, but equally to proceedings instituted before their comm encement.

[188] Thus, provisions regulating, or empowering the court to r egulate, the course of proceedings, affect proceedings pending a t their commencement, unless an intention to the contrary i s clearly shown.” “…. the Courts regard as retrospective any statute which operates on cases or facts coming into existence before its commencement.” In the instant case, the learned counsel for the pa rties were on common ground on the above exposition of the law, inasmuch as every one agreed that the substantive laws apply prospectively unles s the statute expressly or implied provided that it would be applied retros pectively, the procedural laws are generally retrospective and apply to the p ending proceedings with CA 778-2005 ETC 59 the rider that if they affect the existing or accru ed right, they would not apply retrospectively, unless of course the legisla ture intended to do so by express words or necessary implication.

[189] However, th e learned counsel were at variance on the issue whether after the rep eal of the Ordinance of 1979, the respondents had acquired any vested right , or a right had accrued to them on account of the repeal of the Ord inance of 1979, so as not to touch the assessment orders passed under the repealed Ordinance, particularly when section 65 of the repealed Ordina nce, though stood saved under the original Ordinance, was not saved w hile introducing amendments in the Ordinance.

[190] In a somewhat similar context, in the case of Inspecting Additional Commissioner of Income Tax v. Zakaria H.A. Sattar Bilwani, Karachi (C.P. No. 643-K to 647 of 2007 decided on 15.7.2008), this Court noted that section 17-B intr oduced in the Wealth Tax Act, 1963 by means of Finance Act, 1992 was enacted to initiate proceedings in the interest of revenue .

[191] It was held that the amendment brought about by insertion of section 17-B was not merely procedural but also conferred powers to recall cases to the extent that was not available earlier which, by its very nature, was substantive in nature, therefore, it did not operate retrospectively. In this case, the case of Commissioner of Income Tax v.

[192] Eastern Federal Insurance Company [(1982) 46 Tax 6 (SC. Pak)] was also noted wherein the amendment brought about by the Finance Act, 1975 extended the period for re-openin g of a case from four to six years. It was held that the amendment would not be applicable to the cases in which the period of four years had already expired on the ground that the vested right of the party after expiry of four years could not be taken away and therefore the amendment was not attr acted to the case of CA 778-2005 ETC 60 the assessee.

[193] The following portion of the judgment was quoted with approval: - “15. Keeping these principles in view, we are of t he opinion that, even though the amending provisions in questi on, were a part of the procedural laws, they cannot be given retros pective effect, in the facts of the present case. There is no dispute between the parties that, but for the amendments, the business profits for the chargeable accounting period in question, were not liable to be assessed on 31.1.1958.

[194] On the expiry of the period of four years under section 14, the assessee had, therefore, clea rly acquired a right and the assessment for the said period became a past and closed transaction. This right could not, therefore , be taken away by giving retrospective operation to the amended statu tory provisions extending the period for assessment.

[195] The contention s advanced on behalf of the appellant are without substance. We, accordingly, agree with the judgment under appeal.” The introduction of time-limit within which an asse ssment can be amended in both the Ordinances (section 65 of the repealed Ordinance and section 122 of the Ordinance) is a statutory recognition of the protection against arbitrary power of reopening or amending an assessm ent after the expiry of the prescribed period.

[196] Therefore, it could not b e said that in reopening the assessments already completed no right of the a ssessee/taxpayer was involved. 46. It was contended by Mr. Mansoorul Arifin that the provisions of section 122 of the Ordinance relating to amendment of assessment were pari materia with those of section 166A of the repealed Ordinan ce.

[197] He submitted that with the promulgation of the repeale d Ordinance and repeal of the Income Tax Act, 1922 with effect from 1.7.19 79, the provision akin to section 66A, viz., section 34A of the Act of 1922 w as not saved by section 166 of the repealed Ordinance nor such a provision was enacted in the later enactment.

[198] Section 66A was inserted into the repealed Ordinance by the Finance Ordinance, 1980 with effect from 1.7.19 80. The erstwhile CA 778-2005 ETC 61 Central Board of Revenue,5 vide Circular No. I(48)/II/, dated 17.2.1981 stated that section 66A of the repealed Ordinance h ad no retrospective application.

[199] The said provisions were considered by a learned Division Bench of the Lahore High Court in the case of Monnoo Industries Ltd v. C.I.T. (2001 PTD 1525). It was held that section 66A of t he repealed Ordinance was not procedural in nature and, therefo re, it could not have retrospective effect to touch the assessments compl eted before its incorporation into the statute book, particularly i n view of the fact that revisional provisions were not saved by the savings clause contained in section 166 of the repealed Ordinance providing for repeal and savings of the late Income Tax Act, 1922.

[200] Thus, the assessment s pending at the time of enforcement of the repealed Ordinance had to be dealt with as if the repealed Ordinance had not come into force and the assessments finalized before 1.7.1980 could not be reopened under section 66A of the repealed Ordinance. It may be observed that section 66A of the repealed Ordinance provided for revision of the assessment o rders, hence generally speaking it was pari materia , not with section 122 but with section 122A of the Ordinance, which provided for revision of the p roceedings under the Ordinance.

[201] Subsection (5) is pari materia with section 65 of the repealed Ordinance inasmuch as the grounds earlier provided for additional assessment were made the grounds for amendment or f urther amendment under that subsection while section 66A of the repe aled Ordinance qua grounds for revision is pari materia with subsection (5A).

[202] In any event, the High Court in the above case held that section 66A of the repealed Ordinance was not procedural in nature and, therefo re, it could not have 5 Renamed as Federal Board of Revenue. CA 778-2005 ETC 62 retrospective effect to touch the assessments compl eted even though it was not saved under section 166 of the repealed Ord inance. 47.

[203] As put by the Privy Council in the case of Mahaliram Ramjidas (supra), and also reiterated by this Court in the c ases of Khan Bahadur Amiruddin v. West Punjab Province (PLD 1956 FC 220) and Muhammad Amir Khan v. Controller of Estate Duty (PLD 1961 SC 119), there is a distinction between provisions which impose taxes a nd those which provide for the machinery by which tax is assessed and realized.

[204] The provisions relating to imposition of tax are to be strictly construed in favour of the subject so that if there be any substantial doubt, it has to be resolved in his favour. But the machinery sections are to be liberally construed. If the incidence of tax be clear, the machinery sectio ns should be so construed as to make the realization of the proper tax possible.

[205] They should not be so construed as to defeat the intenti on of the legislature and to prevent the realization of the tax that is in fa ct due. However, in our view, the provision is impregnated with an essentia l attribute, which affects an accrued right of an assessee or a taxpayer that after efflux of a certain period of time, his assessment will not be opened o r amended.

[206] Therefore, the section cannot be applied retrospectively unles s the legislature has by express words or necessary implication intended to give it retrospective effect. Our burden, therefore, in the light of the contentions of the learned counsel for the parties is to find from the provisi ons of the Ordinance whether the legislature intended to apply provision s of section 122 retrospectively, either by express words, or by nec essary implication, and what treatment the Ordinance envisaged to be given to the proceedings pending under the repealed Ordinance, including add itional assessment CA 778-2005 ETC 63 under section 65, which, to an extent, is pari materia , with the provisions of subsection (5) of section 122. 48.

[207] The learned counsel for the appellants vehemen tly contended that there was clear distinction between the chargi ng sections (in this case sections 4 to 8 of the Ordinance) and the procedura l or machinery provisions, section 122 being one of them. While th e former sections were to be construed strictly, liberal approach was requ ired to be adopted in the interpretation of the procedural or machinery provi sions, so as to make the machinery workable and the realization of the tax p ossible.

[208] On the other hand, the learned counsel for the respondents took the position that an element of addition of liability was woven into the overall provisions of the Ordinance, particularly into the machinery sections , including section 122, therefore, the same could not be given retrospectiv e effect.

[209] Having anxiously considered the matter, the view we are in clined to take is that the provision is impregnated with the potential of addi ng to the liability of the taxpayer, therefore, the same is not a mere matter of procedure. It has already been held that the taxpayers/assessees have a right that their assessments will not be reopened after the expiry o f the statutory period of five years. 49.

[210] As to the non-incorporation into the original Ordinance of the concept of “ additional assessment on the grounds of escapement of income, etc. ” in the former laws, (later introduced into the Or dinance under subsection (5), or for that matter various other pr ovisions of the repealed Ordinance, the legislature realizing the flaws in t he law, immediately took in hand the work of filling the lacunae and supplyi ng the omissions on successive reviews of the law in its present state.

[211] Thus, on the very day of CA 778-2005 ETC 64 the enforcement of the Ordinance, i.e. 1.7.2002, th e words and figures, “or issued under sections 59, 59A, 62, 63 or 65 of the repealed Ordinance” were inserted in subsection (1) of section 122 alon g side many other amendments and the assessment orders passed under t hose sections were brought within the pale of the amendment power .

[212] Likewise, on insertion of subsection (5) by the Finance Act, 200 3, the pari materia provisions of section 65 (escapement of income from assessment, etc.) were brought on the statute book. These omissions w ere, however, earlier curable with the unamended provision of subsection (1) of section 239 on the statute book, which provided that the repealed Ordinance shall continue to apply to the assessment year ending on the 30 th day of June, 2003, but became incurable with the substitution of that provision with subsections (1), (2) and (3) of section 239 by the Finance Ordinance, 2002 and the Finance Act, 2003, which omitted the en block applicability of the repealed Ordinance to the relevant assessments.

[213] Had the unamended provision of subsection (1) of section 239 continue d on the statute book, no difficulty would have arisen regarding the treat ment of assessment orders passed in respect of the assessment year end ing on 30 th June 2003. In such eventuality, the assessments up to th e said period would have been governed under the repealed Ordinance, wh ile the assessments of the post enforcement period of the O rdinance of 2001 would be governed under the latter Ordinance. 50.

[214] M/S Sirajuddin Khalid and M. Iqbal Hashmi, ASC s argued that the terms ‘tax’, ‘taxable income’ and ‘taxpayer’ as defined in section 2(63), (64) & (66) respectively were restricted to the Ord inance as they did not contain any reference to the corresponding or pari materia provisions in the repealed Ordinance, hence the provisions of the Ordinance could not CA 778-2005 ETC 65 be applied to the assessments completed under the r epealed Ordinance.

[215] The relevant provisions are reproduced below: - “2(63) “Tax” means any tax imposed under Chapter II , and includes any penalty, fee or other charge or any su m or amount leviable or payable under this Ordinance.” (64) “Taxable income” means taxable income as def ined in section 9.” (66) “Taxpayer” means any person who derives an am ount chargeable to tax under this Ordinance and include s --.” A bare perusal of the above provisions shows that h ere too the draftsman failed to create any link between these provisions and the relevant provisions of the repealed Ordinance. 51.

[216] This brings us to the question how this Court can come to the rescue of the draftsman who has left so much to be desired in the Ordinance. To find an answer, reference is made to the case of Muhammad Amir Khan v. Controller of Estate Duty (PLD 1961 SC 119) where this Court considered the question whether th e Finance Act of 1956 was not ultra vires the Central Legislature and, in any case, even if the Finance Act of 1956 was ignored the proper duty cal culated on the basis of determination by the Controller could be realised i n spite of the defective wording of section 57 as it stood before its amendm ent by the Finance Act of 1956.

[217] Another question considered in this case w as whether this Court could modify section 57 so as to bring it in accord with the rest of the Act and the intention of the Legislature. The Court dea lt with the above questions in the following manner: - “We are satisfied that this is a case where the Cou rt can modify the language of an enactment.

[218] It will be observed that there cannot be the slightest doubt in the present case as to the i ntention of the Legislature. In fact, it is admitted on behalf of t he appellants that the failure to make a consequential amendment in sectio n 57 could only be due to a slip. After providing the Controller co uld determine value subject to an appeal to the Appellate Tribunal the Legislature could CA 778-2005 ETC 66 not possibly have intended that duty should be paid only on the account which was filed by the accounting party its elf.

[219] All that has happened is that the draftsman failed to refer in s ection 57 to the provisions relating to determination in accordance with the amended Act. That we can modify the language of an Act to g ive effect to the manifest and undoubted intention of the legislature is a proposition which is well supported by authority and well justi fied in reason.

[220] As stated in Crawford on Statutory Construction (secti on 201 p. 348): "If the true meaning of the legislature appears fro m the entire enactment, errors, mistakes, omissions and misprint s may be corrected by the Court, so that the legislative wil l may not be defeated. As a result, spelling, grammar, numbers a nd even words, may be corrected.

[221] This, as already stated, i s simply making the strict letter of a statute yield to the obvious intent of the Legislators. But it must clearly, or at least w ith reasonable certainty, appear that the error is in fact one bef ore the Court will be justified in making the proper correction o r amendment or the Court will invade the province of the legisl ature and exercise legislative power.

[222] But when satisfied of t he error, the Court may make the necessary correction. In accord with this principle, an erroneous description may be made to describe the thing actually intended or a misnomer made to n ame the thing really meant." In Maxwell's Interpretation of Statutes the rule is thus stated on p. 229, 1953 Edition: "Where the language of the statute, in its ordinary meaning and grammatical constructions, leads to a manifest contradiction of the apparent purpose of the enactm ent, or to some inconvenience or absurdity, hardship or injust ice, presumably not intended, a construction may be put upon it which modifies the meaning of the words, and even t he structure of the sentence." In Salmon v.

[223] Duncombe and others (11 A C 634), thei r Lordships of the Privy Council said "It is, however, a very serious matter to hold that when the main object of a statute is clear, it shall be redu ced to a nullity by the draftsman's unskilfulness or ignorance of la w. It may be necessary for a Court of Justice to come to such a conclusion, but their Lordships hold that nothing can justify i t except necessity or the absolute intractability of the lan guage used.

[224] And they have set themselves to consider, first, wh ether any substantial doubt can be suggested as to the main o bject of the legislature, and, secondly, whether the last ni ne words of section 1 are so cogent and so limit the rest of th e statute as to nullify its effect either entirely or in a very important particular." There being no doubt in the present case that the d uty which the legislature intended to be realized was that which was to be CA 778-2005 ETC 67 determined in accordance with the provisions of the Act.

[225] We find we have jurisdiction to modify section 57 so as to rec tify the draftsman's mistake and to read in it references to the Control ler and the Appellate Tribunal, etc., and we would hold that th e proper duty could be realized in spite of the defective wording of section 57. Stress was laid during argument on the rule that st atutes imposing taxes should be strictly construed.

[226] Any effort to i nvoke the aid of this rule in the present case is misconceived. There is a distinction between provisions which impose taxes and those whi ch provide for the machinery by which tax is assessed and realized . The provisions relating to imposition of tax are to be strictly co nstrued in favour of the subject so that if there be any substantial dou bt it has to be resolved in his favour.

[227] But the machinery sections are to be liberally construed. If the incidence of tax be clear the mac hinery sections should be so construed as to make the realization o f the proper tax possible. They should not be so construed as to def eat the intention of the legislature and to prevent the realization o f the tax that is in fact due.

[228] The distinction stated above was recognis ed by the Federal Court of Pakistan in Khan Bahadur Amiruddin and others v. West Punjab Province (P L D1956 FC 120), where the learned Judges while dealing with a case under the Punjab I mmovable Property Tax Act said: "The Act in question is no doubt a Taxing Act and u nless the liability to be taxed is clear the interpretation s hould be in favour of the subject.

[229] But no question of interpret ation arises regarding section 3, which, in unambiguous terms, d etermines the liability of the lands to be taxed. The provisi ons that have to be interpreted are those relating to the machine ry of the assessment and in respect of such provisions of a t axing Act the Privy Council in Income-tax Commissioner v.

[230] Mah abi Ramjidas AIR 1940 P C 124, observed that that const ruction should be preferred which makes the machinery worka ble." We also agree with the contention of the learned At torney-General that in spite of the defective wording of section 5 7 duty could be realized on account of section 58-D. This section e mpowers the Controller to issue a notice of demand when duty ha s been determined in consequence or in pursuance of an ord er passed under the Act.

[231] In accordance with this section ther efore once the Controller determines the value of the property and the duty that is due, he would have authority to issue a notice of d emand. It has been urged on behalf of the appellants that this em powers only the issue of notice and does not contain any specific p rovision as to the realization of the duty.

[232] It appears to us to be inv olved in the authority to issue notice that the amount mentioned in the no tice can be realized. We may mention before concluding the contention pre ssed before us by Mr. Suhrawardy that the Controller and the Go vernment were only taking advantage of a technicality inasmuch as the High Court may very well have allowed Writ Petition No.  and may have granted a writ forbidding the Controller from takin g further steps.

[233] We CA 778-2005 ETC 68 may point out that it is only the appellants who ha ve been trying to take advantage of a technicality and they have fail ed. The liability of payment of estate duty arose in the year 1952 when Sir Muhammad Akbar Khan died and in accordance with the Estate D uty Act the value of the estate of Sir Muhammad Akbar Khan was to be assessed by the Controller.

[234] The amendment of 1953 h ad come into force before the year allowed to the Central Board of Revenue for reference to the High Court expired. The Controller admittedly had on account of the amendment the power to determine value. The appellants had objected to the exercise of jurisdic tion on the ground of a drafting error.

[235] This objection though conceded in a limited form by the Advocate-General of Pakistan in 1955 had no force and is now being overruled. The effect of the judgment is that proceedings before the Controller shall have their ordinary and natural course.” Thus, in the course of interpretation of statutes, this Court while ascertaining the manifest, undoubted and true will and intent of the legislation, is fully competent and empowered not o nly to fill the lacuna or supply the omissions, but also to point to the defi ciencies or the excesses that have crept into the legislation due to the uns kilfulness of the draftsman against the legislative will. 52.

[236] In the instant appeals, as noted earlier, leav e to appeal was granted to examine the scope, effect and validity o f section 122. The learned counsel for the respondents had to devote c onsiderable time in arguing excessive and repetitive power to amend ves ted in the Commissioner at the cost of arbitrariness.

[237] The lear ned counsel vehemently contended that arbitrary powers were given to the C ommissioner to amend an assessment and the draftsman failed to properly depict the legislative intent in this regard, which was to confer the powe r of amendment of assessment on the Commissioner simpliciter. Though, in response the learned counsel for the appellants contended that s ubsection (1) of section 122 was an enabling provision and the power of amen dment was to be exercised subject to the constraints and restrictio ns imposed on it in the remaining parts of the section, but the fact remain s that the power presents CA 778-2005 ETC 69 a draconian façade to a taxpayer.

[238] To begin with, su bsection (1) invests the Commissioner with the power to amend an assessment order by making such alterations or additions as he considers neces sary. Next, subsection (3) says that the Commissioner shall be treated as having made an amended assessment of the taxable income and tax pa yable thereon as set out in the revised return furnished by a taxpay er in terms of subsection (6) of section 114.

[239] Under subsection (4), where an assessment order has been amended under subsection (1) or (3), the Commi ssioner may further amend it as many times as may be necessary over a period of five years after the issuance of the assessment order, o r a period of one year after the issuance of amended assessment order.

[240] Amb iguity abounds in the subsection. Under this subsection, the Commissi oner may further amend an assessment 100 times or 1000 times within the five years time- limit. The order passed under subsection (1) will b e an amended assessment order. The revised return filed under su bsection (3) shall also be treated as an amended assessment.

[241] One is left wo ndering from which assessment order the period of five years, or one y ear will be computed, from the date of the revised return, which in itsel f is an amended assessment order under subsection (3)(a), or an ord er amending assessment for the first time, or the hundredth tim e under subsection (4).

[242] Subsection (4A) is another patch work done for the limited purpose of saving the time-limit prescribed in section 65 of t he repealed Ordinance for dealing with the assessments made under that provis ion. Again, this would not have been required had the unamended provision of section 239(1) of the Ordinance continued on the statute book.

[243] No dou bt, subsection (5) stipulates the conditions under which the power to amend an assessment is to be exercised, but its placement in the sectio n suggests, though CA 778-2005 ETC 70 incorrectly, as if it is an independent power of am endment. If the grounds for amendment or further amendment were provided in subsection (1) itself, or the same were suffixed immediately after it, it would be easily comprehended.

[244] The absurdity, inconvenience and hard ship are manifest. Then is subsection (5A), which provides that the Co mmissioner may amend, or further amend an assessment order, if he considers that the assessment order is erroneous in so far it is preju dicial to the interest of revenue. Indeed, it is an independent power, apart from the power of amendment contained in subsections (1), (3) & (4).

[245] That is why, the draftsman provided in subsection (5B) the time-limi t within which this power was to be exercised. In this subsection, sepa rate reference to subsection (9) – affording of opportunity of hearin g to the taxpayer, is made. From the language of subsection (9), the prov ision appears to be applicable to the section as a whole and would be a ttracted to innumerable amendments or further amendments of assessments env isaged therein.

[246] The reference does not depict the legislative inten t. 53. It was conceded by the learned counsel for the appellants that subsection (5A) provided an independent power of am endment or further amendment of assessment. Mr. M. Ilyas Khan stated t hat the power under subsection (5) was original in nature while that un der subsection (5A) was revisional in nature.

[247] In fact, the grounds for amen dment or further amendment provided in this subsection were the grou nds for revision under section 66A of the repealed Ordinance. Now, t he assessment orders are subject to a double revision. One is by the Com missioner under section 122A where no specific ground for revision is provided, but is to be made on an inquiry conducted in the matter.

[248] The oth er is by the Regional Commissioner under section 122B in a matter relatin g to issuance of an CA 778-2005 ETC 71 exemption or lower rate certificate with regard to collection or deduction of tax at source under the Ordinance. Here too, an imp ression of excessive powers surfaces. Then, the Ordinance provides in se ction 221 for rectification of mistakes, inter alia, by the Commissioner.

[249] Subsection (1A) specifically empowers the Commissioner to amend any order passed under the repealed Ordinance by the Deputy Commissi oner, etc. There is a need to review the language, content and scope of the power to amend and further amend an assessment, the power to revis e an assessment and the power to rectify mistakes envisaged in these se ctions so as to make it in line with the legislative intent of consolidatin g the law relating to income tax so as to make it easily comprehensible to the c onvenience of the taxpayers. 54.

[250] A perusal of section 65 of the repealed Ordina nce shows that a period of five years was provided for issuing not ice to an assessee to initiate proceedings for additional assessment in t he cases of escapement of income from assessment, etc. Time-limit of five years, with certain changes is also envisaged under subsections (2) & ( 4) of section 122 of the Ordinance within which power to amend an assess ment may be exercised.

[251] Keeping the former and the present state s of law in view, the irresistible conclusion appears to be that the asse ssments completed under the repealed Ordinance ought to be governed b y the old law while the assessments of the post-enforcement period of t he Ordinance are to be governed by the new law.

[252] This treatment of the t wo sets of assessments would also avert the anomaly that would be created if the assessments of the period up to 30 th June, 2003 were excluded from the operation of the previous law on account of its rep eal, and not included in the new law on account of its being prospective in application.

[253] It appears CA 778-2005 ETC 72 that the respondents have been trying to take advan tage of the technicalities, but we are afraid, they must fail. If their cases do not fall within the ambit of provisions of section 122 on ac count of the same being prospective, they cannot exclude their assessments from the purview of section 65 of the repealed Ordinance merely because of the lapse of the draftsman who omitted subsection (1) of section 239 at the amendment stage.

[254] Had the provisions of subsection (1) of sect ion 239 of the Ordinance continued on the statute book, there would have bee n no ambiguity and no difficulty at all. In that eventuality, the assessm ents up to the period ending on 30 th June 2002 would be governed by the relevant provis ions of the repealed Ordinance as if the Ordinance had not come into force. 55.

[255] At this stage, we may take up another contenti on of the learned counsel for the appellants that in some of the cases, the writ petitions were filed in the High Court against the issuance of show cause notices by the taxation officers though appropriate remedies were available to them under the law in the form of appeal/revisio n before the concerned Income Tax authorities.

[256] It was contended that inste ad of availing the aforesaid remedies, the assessees/taxpayers directl y filed the writ petitions and the High Courts also incorrectly entertained th e same, though the same were not maintainable. On the other hand, the learned counsel for the respondents submitted that the writ petitions w ere filed against the issuance of show cause notices on the ground of lac k of authority and jurisdiction in the Income Tax authorities under th e Ordinance.

[257] It was also submitted that the contention of the learned counse l for the appellants was of no significance particularly when the High Court s in a large number of tax references also reached the same conclusion tha t the provisions of CA 778-2005 ETC 73 section 122 of the Ordinance were prospective in op eration and the relevant assessments could not be reopened under th ose provisions. 56.

[258] In Commissioner of Income Tax v. Hamdard Dawakhana (Waqf) (PLD 1992 SC 847) this Court quoted with app roval the observation in an earlier case 6 that the tendency to bypass the remedy provided in the relevant statute and to press into service constitu tional jurisdiction of the High Court was to be discouraged, though in certain cases invoking of such jurisdiction instead of availing the statutory remedy was justified , e.g. when the impugned order/action was palpably without jurisdiction and/or mala fide .

[259] It was further held that to force an aggrieved pe rson in such a case to approach the forum provided under the relev ant statute may not be just and proper. In the said case, the appellant ha d opted to avail of the hierarchy of the forums provided for under the repe aled Ordinance up to the stage of filing of appeal before the Tribunal, but then instead of making a reference to the High Court, filed a Constitution Petition in the High Court.

[260] It was observed that once a party opted to i nvoke the remedies provided for under the relevant statute, he could n ot at his sweet will switch over to constitutional jurisdiction of the High Cou rt in the mid of the proceedings in the absence of any compelling and ju stifiable reason . Incidentally, that is not the position in the insta nt cases where some of the respondents directly filed writ petitions in the Hi gh Courts and challenged the competence and validity of the show cause notic es issued to them.

[261] Here, the ratio of the judgment of this Court in Murree Brewery Co. Ltd v. Pakistan (PLD 1972 SC 279) is more pertinently attracted. I n this case, the appellant challenged the very jurisdiction of the C apital Development Authority acting under the Capital Development Auth ority Ordinance, 1960 6 C.A.

[262] No. 79-K of 1991 CA 778-2005 ETC 74 to make the impugned acquisition under the Ordinanc e. It was held that if the appellant succeeded in establishing that the im pugned acquisition was ultra vires the Ordinance, its appeal under section 36 would b e an exercise in futility. It was further held that the rule that the High Court would not entertain a writ petition when other appropriate re medy was yet available was not a rule of law barring jurisdiction, but a r ule by which the Court regulated its jurisdiction.

[263] It was noted that one o f the well recognized exceptions to the general rule was a case where an order was attacked on the ground that it was wholly without authority. Wh ere a statutory functionary acted mala fide or in a partial, unjust and oppressive manner, the High Court in the exercise of its writ jurisdic tion had power to grant relief to the aggrieved party.

[264] It was also observed that the appeal under section 36 was limited to a matter which was within the jurisdiction of the authority concerned and the scope of the Ordinance. It was concluded that the question of jurisdiction was a matter for revie w, which was based not on the merits but on the legality of the lower auth ority’s proceedings.

[265] In the instant cases too, the jurisdiction of the Income T ax authorities to issue the impugned show cause notices was successfully brough t under challenge before the High Courts and it was found that the no tices were not competently issued in view of the prospective appli cation of the provisions of section 122 of the Ordinance.

[266] The case of Pak Arab Fertilizers (Pvt.) Ltd relied upon by Mr. M. Ilyas Khan was not relevant, as no factual controversies were involved in the writ petitions f iled by the respondents in these matters. The objection of the learned counsel , in the light of the above well-settled law, is overruled. 57.

[267] In the light of the above discussion, we uphol d view of the Sindh High Court taken in Honda Shahra-e-Faisal and followed by the CA 778-2005 ETC 75 other High Courts as also the Income Tax authoritie s that the provisions of section 122 of the Ordinance are prospective in the ir application and do not apply to the assessment of a year ending on or before 30 th June, 2002.

[268] On that account the appeals are bound to fail and t he impugned judgments would be upheld. However, the learned High Courts h ave not adverted to the question of treatment of assessments of the per iod preceding the enforcement of the Ordinance. As already noted, sec tion 65 of the repealed Ordinance provided a period of five years for additional assessment and such assessments were to be dealt wi th under the said provision in accordance with original section 239(1 ) of the Ordinance.

[269] The learned High Courts failed to take into considerati on this aspect of the matter and did not direct that the assessments comp leted under the repealed Ordinance would be subject to the provisio ns of the said Ordinance, as originally provided in unamended sect ion 239(1), but not clearly and properly provided in the Ordinance at t he amendment stage.

[270] We fill this lacuna in the impugned judgments and d irect that the assessment of any year ending on or before 30 th June, 2002 would be governed by the repealed Ordinance and shall be dea lt with as if the Ordinance had not come into force. In taking this v iew, we are fortified by a passage from the Maxwell on Interpretation of Statu tes, 10 th Edition (1953), p. 228, which reads as under: - “Where rights and procedure are dealt with togethe r, the intention of the legislature may well be that the o ld rights are to be determined by the old procedure, and that only the new rights under the substituted section are to be dealt with by the new procedure.” 58.

[271] Mr. Shahid Jameel Khan, learned counsel for th e appellants in C.A. No. 44 to 49 of 2009 stated that the issue for adjudication in these appeals before the High Court related to section 12 (18) of the Ordinance in CA 778-2005 ETC 76 respect of assessment years 1999-2000 to 2002-2003, which was not touched upon by the learned Judges in the impugned judgments.

[272] He, therefore, submitted that the proceedings, which we re the subject-matter of the said appeals were required to be remanded to th e High Court for decision in accordance with law. He further submitt ed that the assessments relating to 1994-1995 and 1999-2000 wer e to be governed under section 122 of the Ordinance.

[273] Therefore, to t hat extent, the appeals would be dealt with in the light of the decision of this Court in other appeals. 59. As to Civil Appeals No. 50 & 51 of 2009, Mr. S hahid Jameel Khan, learned counsel for the appellants stated tha t the issue for adjudication before the High Court related to secti on 221 of the Ordinance, i.e. rectification of assessments of the year 1998- 1999, but the same was not touched upon by the learned Judges in the impug ned judgments.

[274] Likewise, in respect of assessments 2000-2001, 2001 -2002 and 2002- 2003 the issue for adjudication before the High Cou rt related to disallowance of interest expense, which too was not touched upon by the learned Judges in the impugned judgments. Only one assessment year, i.e. 1998-1999 related to section 122.

[275] He, therefor e, submitted that the appeals to the extent of section 221 and disallowan ce of interest expense may be remanded to the learned High Court for decis ion according to law. 60. There is force in the submissions of the learn ed counsel. Accordingly, the appeals are partly allowed and the impugned judgments set aside to the above extent.

[276] The proceedings are remanded to the learned High Court for decision in accordance with law. As to section 122, the appeals will follow the decision of this Court in other appeals. CA 778-2005 ETC 77 61. The learned counsel next submitted that C.A. N o. 1099 to 1101 of 2008 were inadvertently clubbed in the High Court with section 122 cases, though these appeals related to rectific ation of assessment orders under section 221 of the Ordinance.

[277] We have examined the case files and have gone through the grounds of PTR No. 9, 10 & 11 of 2008 filed before the High Court. The assessments in the se cases were rectified under section 221 and refunds of differen t sums of money were created. Subsequently, the assessments were reopene d under section 122(5A) on the ground of being erroneous and prejud icial to the interest of revenue.

[278] The order was upheld in appeal before t he Commissioner. However, the Appellate Tribunal allowed the appeal of the assessee. Consequently, the statements filed by her under sec tions 115(4) and 143B in respect of assessment year 2002-2003 were a ccepted and the rectification made under section 221 was revived.

[279] T he precise contention of the learned counsel for the appellant was that the learned High Court decided these cases along with the conne cted cases on the issue of prospectivity or retrospectivity of sectio n 122, and did not go into the actual controversy raised in these cases, i.e. the rectification of the relevant assessments, therefore, the appeals we re required to be remanded to the High Court for decision in accordan ce with law.

[280] We uphold the contention of the learned counsel. Thus, the appeals are partly allowed and the cases remanded to the learne d High Court for decision in accordance with law. Obviously, if any question pertaining to the application of section 122 be raised, the same would be governed by this judgment. CA 778-2005 ETC 78 62.

[281] Mr. M. Ilyas Khan, Sr. ASC, learned counsel fo r the appellants in C.A. No.826 & 1102 of 2008 submitted that these appeals may be delinked as a different question of law was involved in it. Mr. Sirajuddin Khalid, ASC, learned counsel for the res pondent in C.A. No. subscribed to the submission of the lea rned counsel for the appellant.

[282] Order accordingly. 63. Mr. Shahid Jameel Khan, ASC further submitted that C.A. No. was required to be delinked as a differ ent question of law was involved therein. We have examined the case fil e and have found that the said appeal involves the common question o f law relating to prospectivity or retrospectivity of section 122 of the Ordinance.

[283] Therefore, the same cannot be delinked and will be governed by this judgment. 64. In the result, the titled appeals and petition s will be governed by the following orders: - (1) Civil Appeals No. 1617, 1622-1624, 2673 & 2675- 2678 of 2006, and Civil Appeals No. 497, 498, 911, 916, 100 2, 1003, & 2282–2292 of 2008 are dismissed as withdraw n with the observation that the assessment of any inc ome year ending on or before 30 th June 2002 shall be governed by the repealed Ordinance as if the Ordinance had n ot come into force as held in Para 54 above. (2) Civil Appeals No. 1099 to 1101 of 2008 and Civi l Appeals No. 44 to 51 of 2009 are partly allowed, the judgme nts of the High Court are set aside and the matters remand ed to the concerned High Court for decision according to law. (3) Civil Appeals No. 826 & 1102 of 2008 are delink ed and adjourned to a date in office.

[284] CA 778-2005 ETC 79 (4) All the remaining civil appeals and civil petit ions are dismissed with no order as to costs. CHIEF JUSTICE JUDGE JUDGE Islamabad Announced on ___________. CHIEF JUSTICE APPROVED FOR REPORTING
