[2] Mazhar Sher Awan, Additional Prosecutor General , Punjab with Furqan, S.I. Date of Hearing : 16.05.2019 JUDGMENT Qazi Muhammad Amin Ahmed , J.- Bisma Murad, 11, left home on 21.11.2011 to attend school ; she did not return at the expected time whereupon her father , Murad Ali, PW -13 went to the school ; he was informed that the girl did not turn up ; a day passed by in search and finally the incident was reported at Police Station Nawan Kot, Lahore on 22.11.2011 ; after receipt of call s from two different cell phone numbers whereby the unknown caller demand ed ransom of Rs.50,000 .

[3] The complainant alongside Shahzad, PW went to the designated place with the amount once again and dropped it inside the corn er of a steel fence ; the caller directed them towards main road Sabza Zar to receive the abductee, however, to their dismay none were there. A dead body was spotted at about noon time identified by the complainant as that of his missing daughter Bisma Mura d.

[4] According to the autopsy report, she was strangulated to death ; hymen was found freshly ruptured with tears on anal opening ; swabs bore seminal Criminal Appeal No .122-L of 2017 . 2 traces without DNA identification . Trial before learned Special Judge, Anti Terrorism Court No.II culminated into appellant’s conviction under Sections 302(b), 365 -A of the Pakistan Penal Code, 1860 read with Section 7 (e) of Anti Terrorism Act, 1997 .

[5] The learned High Court maintained the convictions . As the investigation progressed, Iftikhar Rasool, Inspector , PW-17, with the help of cell phone dat a, tracked through IMEI number , arrested the appellant on 25.11.2011 ; upon his personal search, a cell phone hand set , P-8 with a sim (Subscriber Identity Module) bearing No.0308 -4262290, P -9 with cash Rs.10,000 were recovered .

[6] The accused was lodged in judicial lockup with muffled face. He was presented before Muhammad Iqbal and Muhammad Ramzan , PWs , witnesses of last seen on 3.12.2011; they correctly identified him during the test identification parade; later, while taking the girl on motorbike and former , throwing a bag in the plot wherefrom the dead body was recovered .

[7] The appellant was remitted to police custody; pursuant to a disclosure he led to the recovery of various incriminatory articles that included a part of ransom amount ; most importantly last belongings of the deceased . Learned trial Judge returned a guilty verdict ; he stood convicted and sentenced as referred to above vide judgment dated 8.10.2012 ; his appeal before a learned division bench of Lahore H igh Court met with no better fate vide impugned judgment dated 10.2.2015. 2.

[8] Prosecution’s case is primarily structured upon the statement of Muhammad Ramzan, PW; he is complainant’s nephew and claim s to have last seen the girl in appellant’s company on 21.11.2011 ; he shared information with the complainant on the following day and it was on this disclosure that the appellant was framed as suspect.

[9] This piece of evidence is further corroborated with the statement of Muhammad Iqbal, PW - 11 who saw the appe llant dumping the c orpse; both of them correctly identified the appellant under magisterial supervision , a process substantially flawless . Defence has not been able to impeach credibility of these witnesses ; they have no a xe to grind.

[10] Evidence of the last seen is well within the remit of proximity of Criminal Appeal No .122-L of 2017 . 3 time and space . Recovery of articles constitutes an another strong link particularly last belongings including school bag as well as stationery items . Recovery of sim (Subscriber Identity Module) P-9 and genera tion of calls therefrom , received by the complainant , confirm ed by cell phone data presents a formidable piece of evidence , based upon an automat ed system , immune from foreign interference.

[11] Investigative process and conclusion thereof inexorably points tow ards the appellant’s culpability. Circumstances though few, nonetheless, are well synchronized , excluding every hypothesis of appellant’s innocence . He has rightly been convicted by the learned Courts below , therefore, his appeal must fail .

[12] Prosecution’s failure of DNA profile generation of rectal and vaginal swabs is a most grievous lapse that in retrospect makes out a case to visit the appellant with alternate penalty of imprisonment for life , therefore death penalty on all counts is altered to imprisonme nt for life on each; amounts of fine and compensation are kept intact.

[13] Sentences shall run concurrently with benefit of Section 382 -B of the Code of Criminal Procedure . With the above modification, Criminal Appeal 122 -L/2017 is allowed . JUDGE JUDGE Lahore , the 16th of May, 2019 Ghulam Raza /* JUDGE
