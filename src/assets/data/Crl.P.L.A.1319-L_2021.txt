[1] order dated 5.8.2021 passed by the Lahore H igh Court Lahore in Crl. Misc. No.450305 -B/2021) Shahid Aslam …Petitioner (s) Versus The State …Res pondent (s) For the Petitioner (s): Mr. Mazhar Iqbal Sidhu, ASC For the State : Rana Abdul Majid, Addl. Prosecutor General Punjab with Bilal Mehmood Sul ehri, ASP and Javed, I.O.

[2] For the Complainant : Ch. Abdul Wahid, ASC Mian Ghulam Hussain, AOR Date of Hearing: 05.01.2022. ORDER Qazi Muhammad Amin Ahmed, J. :- Shahid Aslam, petitioner herein, was earlier booked by Green Town police Lah ore for issuing a bank cheque in sum of rupees 7 million , bounced upon presentation . It is in this backdrop that he settled the issue by issuing another cheque in favour of the complainant before a learned Judge -in-Chamber of the Lahore High Court Lahore , in consequence whereof, he was admitted to anticipatory bail vide order dated 11.8.2014 ; the second cheque also failed upon presentation, bringing him back once again behind the bars on 14.6.2021 . 2.

[3] Chequered successive failures, notwithstanding, the learned counsel contends that the petitioner had cleared up substantial portion of his liability , a position though contested at the bar, nonetheless, confirmed by Bilal Mehmood Sule hri, Assistant Superintendent of Police . 3. Heard. Record perused. 4.

[4] Be that as it may, what appears to have weighed with the learned Judge -in-Chamber to deny post arrest bail to the petitioner is his failure to recompense the complainant , a pledge that he made before the Court, in lieu whereof, he was extended extraordinary c oncession of pre -arrest bail . The arrangement , seemingly under the sword of democles fails to commend our approval , inasmuch as , the Court being a neutral arbiter owed responsibility to none except the law .

[5] Parameters for grant of pre - arrest bail , by now , are authoritatively well settled , to be followed faithfully and, thus, there was no space to be allocated to the petitioner to barter his freedom , in derogation thereof ; petitioner’s unenviable conduct , notwithstanding, nonetheless, does not alter the abov e juridical position.

[6] Charged with an offence that does not attract the statutory bar, the petitioner is in custody since 14.6.2021 , continuation whereof, is not likely to serve any useful purpose preceding final adjudication ; as case for his release on bail stands made out . Criminal Petition is converted into appeal and allowed; the petitioner/appellant is admitted to bail on his furnishing bond in the sum of Rs.500,000/ - with one surety in the like amount to the satisfaction of the learned trial Court.
