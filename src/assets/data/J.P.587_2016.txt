[3] I S. uI6 Cr.P.C. was also extended to him. Being aggrieved, petitioner and Muhammad ZareefBhatti riled appeals before the Peshawar High Court, Peshawar which were dismissed the impugned judgment dated 11 11.2014 - Hence, this petition for leave to appeal by the petitioner Qaiser through jail. 3. We have heard the learned counsel for the petitioner as well as the learned Additional Advocate General.

[4] KPK and perused the available record alongwith the impugned judgment with their assistance and observed that in this ease the prosecution has failed to establish the safe custody and safe transmission of sample parcels to the concerned laboratory. This court had laid down in many judgments that the representative samples of the alleged drug must be kept in safe custody and undergo safe transmission from the stage of recovery till its submission to the office of the Government analyst.

[5] Non establishing the said facts would cost doubt and would impair and vitiate the concluseness and reliability of the report of the Government analyst. Thus rendering it incapable of sustaining conviction. 4. In the present case no police official was produced before the Trial Court to report about safe custody of samples if entrusted to him for being Rep' in the Malkhana in safe custody.

[6] Even the police official whose belt number (FC 4225) has been mentioned by the Government analyst in his report, was not produced by the prosecution to depose regarding the safe deposit IT the said sample parcels in the concerned laborator y. The record reveals that the recovery was allegedly affected on 19.08.2011 whereas, according i.e the report of chemical examiner, the sample parcels were received in I he said office on 26.08.2011.

[7] Nobody from the prosecution side was produced to claim that during this period the said sample parcels remained intact in his possession or under his control in the M&khanu in safe custody. Even the prosccuiion is silent as to where remained these sample parcels from 19.08.2011 to 26.08.2011. In absence of establishing the safe custody and safe transmission, the element of tempering cannot be excluded in this case.

[8] The chain of custody of sample parcels begins from the recover y of the narcotics by the police including the separation of reprcsriitative samples of the recovered narcotics, their dispatch to the MaIk-hana and further dispatch to the tesiing lahoratoiy The said chain of custod y and transmission was pivotal as the entire construct of the Act 1997 and the Control of Narcotic Substances (Government Analysts) Rules 2001 (Rules 20011, rests upon the report of the analyst.

[9] It is prosecutions bounded duty that such chain of custody must be safe and secure because the report of chemical examiner enjoined critical importance under the Act 1997, and the chain of custody ensure the reaching of correct representative samples to the office of chemical examiner Any break in the chain of custody i.e. the safe custody or sale transmission of the reprcsentativc samples, makes the report of chemical examiner worthless and un-reliable for justifying conviction of the accused.

[10] Such laps on the part of the prosecution would cast doubt and would vitiate the conclusiveness and reliability of the report of chemical examincr. Reliance can be made upon the judgments rendered by three members benches of this court I.e. Ikramuflah V. the State (2015 SCMR 1002), the State v. Imam B&ChSh ( 2018 S'CMR 2039), Abdul Ghani a the State (2019 SCMR 608), Kamran Shah is the State (2019 SCMR 1217), Mist.

[11] Russia Sultana v. the State (2019 SCMR 1300), Fainrt AU V. the State (2019 SCMR 1649), Zahir Shah alias Shat is State thn AG KPK (2019 SCMR 2004), Hall Nawaz V. the State 2020 SCMR 687), Qaiser Khan V. the State (2021 SCMR 3631, Mn. Sakfna Ram.zan v. the State (2021 SCMR 451), Zubair Khan is the State (2021 SCMR 492) and Guizar a the State 2021 SCMR 380). 5 Although the learned Additional Advocate General, KPK tried to persuade us for deviation from the earlier judgments but it is quite clear from the judgments of this Court that 3-Members Bench remained unanimous that the prosecution is required to prove the sale custody and safe transmission of the sample parcels.

[12] It is now established that the decision of a bench of certain member of judges is binding on the subsequent bench of the same strength and if a subsequent bench of the sam" strength wants to lake a different view the only possibility is to refer the matter to the Chief Justice of Pakistan for the constitution of a larger bench, even a decision of a bench of equal strength is not brought into the notice of a subsequent bench of same strength and it expresses 'a contrary view, then the later decision is a judgment per incuriam. 6.

[13] In We case of Mst. Sarnrana Nawaz p. M.CH. Hank Ltd. (PLD 021 SC 581) it was held that earlier judgment of a Bench of the Supreme Court was binding not only upon the Benches of smaller / 2&J numeric strength but also upon the Benches of co-equal strength a Bench of co-equal strength could not dcviate from the view held by an earlier Bench, and if a contrary view had to be taken, then the proper course was to request the Chief iustice of the Supreme Court for constitution of a larger Bench to reconsider the earlier view.

[14] Smaller Bench cannot request for the constitution of a larger Bench to revisit the opinion of a larger Bench or' any (location or principle of law. View expressed by a three member Bench of the Supreme Court could only he changed or deviated, from a Bench of equal number for which the forum provided by law was to request the Chief Justice for constitution of a larger Bench.

[15] In the cases of Multiline AssociateS a Ardeshir Cowasjcc (PLD 1995 SC 423) and Wak Limited Muttan Road, Lahore V. collector Central Excise and_ Saks Tax.Lahore (now CommissIoner Inland Revenue. LTU. Lahore) (2018 SCMR 1474) it was held that earlier judgment of equal Bench of the High Court on the same point was binding on the subsequent Bench and if the subsequent Bench tended to take a different view, it had to request for the conist! 'ation of larger Bench.

[16] In the case of Unionof India & others p. S.K. hialloor 1(2011) 4 8CC 5391 it was held that if a subsequent coordinate Bench of equal strength wants to take a different view, it can only refer the matter to a larger Bench, otherwise the prior decisioi or a co-ordinate Bench is binding on the subsequent Bench of equal strength and if any subsequent judgment by deviating from the earlier judgment of equal number of bench, would be perincurium.

[17] Same was the view of this court In Ardeshir Cowasjee and 10 others Vs. Karachi Building Control Authorit y KMCL Karachi and 4 others (1999 SCMR 2833). Thus tire judgments passed by the 3-Members Benches, mentioned above, have binding effect upon equal or less Member Benches of this Court, unlcss contrary is declared by a larger Bench of this Court. 7.

[18] It is also a circumstance that the Act 1997 provide sever punishment, therefore, their proof has to be seen strictly and the benefit of any doubt in the prosecution case must be extended to the accused because harder the sentence is, stricter the standard of proof should be. Because for convicting an accused person for such a severe punishrilcfli the bounded dut y of the prosecution is to prove the case without an y breakage of chain, as discussed above. -I. - - ,i)fl) 8.

[19] For the forgoing reasons, this petition is converted into an appeal and the same is allowed. The conviction and sentence of petitioner Qaisar, passed by the trial court and upheld by the High Court, is hereb y sc I aside and he is acquitted of the charge in the instant caseS He be released from jail forthwith if not required to be detained in any other case Cr!.

[20] S.M.R.P. No. 14of2022 9. Pci it ioner Muhammad Zareef Uhatti alongwith Qaisar was indicted in case FIR No 333 dated 19 08.20 TI regisiered under section 9 (c of the Control of Nat-colic Substances Act, 1997 ('Act, 19971 at police station University 'l'owri, Peshawar After conclusion of trial, learned trial court vide judgment dated 21.062012 convicted the petitioner and Qaisar under section 9 (c) of the Act, 1997 and sentenced them i t (Tiprisonnient for lire with a fine of Rs.25 ,000 / - or in default of paymeti t Of fine to further undergo six months simple imprisonment.

[22] The mater was reft2r'ed to the Hon'ble Chief Jusi ice and it was ordered by the Forcible Chief Justice that this Jail Petition No. 447 of 2014 be taken up as Suit Motor Review Petition and he heard alongvith Jail Petition No. 587 012015 (ready decided above) 10. As in this case neither the sale custod y nor the safe transmission was established by the prosecution and we have extended the benefit of such defect in the prosecution case to co -convict Qaiser, so the same benefit is also extended to the petitioner Muhammad Zareel Bhatti, as mentioned above.
