[22] The enquiry culminated in the award of major penalty of termination of service. The High Court allowed the constitution petition on the ground that the order passed was not sustainable as the procedure prescribed in Removal from Service (Special Powers) Ordinance 2000 [hereinafter referred to as the ‘Ordinance 2000’] had n ot been followed. 3.

[23] In Civil Appeal Nos. 177 -K/2010, 178 -K/2010, 65 - K/2011, 66 -K/2011, 83 -K/2011, 91 -K/2011, 135 -K/2011 & 232 - K/2011 the respondents are employees of various organizations which are admittedly under the control of Federal Government .

[25] Federation of Pakistan and others (PLD 2006 SC 602) . They filed Constitution petitions and relying on a judgment of this Court in Civil Aviation Authority through its Director General Vs. Javed Ahmed and another (2009 SCMR 956), the High Court of Sindh held that if an employee is proceeded under the Ordinance, 2000, the High Court is competent to consider as to whether the action taken was in accordance with law or no t.

[26] A Division Bench of the High Court having decided the question of jurisdiction directed the Constitution petitions to be listed bef ore the appropriate benches. 4. In Civil Appeal No. 142 -K/2009 the respondent was an employee of the NED University of Engineering & Technology, Karachi.

Military Lands and Cantonment Rawalpindi and others Vs. Syed Ibrahim Shah and others (2007 PLC (C .S) 1288) to hold that the Ordinance, 2000 being general law has overriding effect and the proceedings held under the University Statute of 1990 could not be sustained.

In Civil Appeal N o. 75 -K/2012, respondent was an employee of the S.M.E.

[35] Bank. He was proceeded against under the Ordinance 2000 and awarded major penalty of termination of his CIVIL APPEAL NOs. , , , 142 -K/2009, 177 - K/2010, 178 -K/2010, 228 -K/2010, 57 -K/2011, 63 -K/2011, 65 -K/2011, 66 - K/2011, 83 -K/2011, 91 -K/2011, 135 -K/2011, 136 -K/2011, 137 -K/2011, 188 - K/2011, 232 -K/2011, 75 -K/2012 AND 82-K/2012 12 service vide order dated 1.12.2000.

[36] The said order was however withdrawn by the competent authori ty; he was reinstated but later onfresh enquiry was held which culminated in the award of the same major penalty of dismissal from service vide order dated 12.12.2001. He challenged the order in appeal before the Service Tribunal which was allowed vide ord er dated 19.3.2010.

[38] The said Committee, however, did not grant him b ack benefits whereafter he approached the High Court in constitution petition which was allowed inter alia on the ground that there was no evidence on record that he was gainfully employed and merely because he had invested some money in defense certificat es does not disentitle him to back benefits.

[39] Gist of the Arguments: 12. In support of Civil Appeal No.  learned counsel for the appellant s Mr. Khalid Javed, ASC submitted that the learned High Court of Sindh has failed to appreciate that the service of the respondent w as neither regulated by any law nor statutory rules of service and the petition under Article 199 of the Constitution was not maintainable ; that the learned High Court has failed to consider that the termination order dated 9.9.2008 of CIVIL APPEAL NOs. , , , 142 -K/2009, 177 - K/2010, 178 -K/2010, 228 -K/2010, 57 -K/2011, 63 -K/2011, 65 -K/2011, 66 - K/2011, 83 -K/2011, 91 -K/2011, 135 -K/2011, 136 -K/2011, 137 -K/2011, 188 - K/2011, 232 -K/2011, 75 -K/2012 AND 82-K/2012 13 the respondent was a ‘termination simplicitor’ and there b eing no stigma attached the petition for reinstatement was not maintainable; that the learned Court fell in er ror in not appreciating that the Ordinance, 2000, did not provide substantive rights to employees but only laid down procedure for taking action against them for any act or omission which may fall within the mischief of law and that the service of the respondent was being regulated by regulations which were non -statutory and therefore, the Consti tution petition was not maintainable. 13.

[40] In support of the submissions made, learned counsel relied on Pakistan International Airline Corporation Vs. Tanweer - ur-Rehman (PLD 2010 SC 676 (relevant paras 19, 23 25 ), Pakistan Telecommunication Co. Ltd Vs. Iqbal Nasir (PLD 2011 SC 132), R.T.H. Janjua Vs.

[43] ASC defended the impugned judgments of the learned High Court as according to them the Constitution petitions were maintainable because the Ordinance, 2000 had an overriding effect and any violation t hereof was amenable to writ jurisdiction of the High Court.

[48] Federation of Pakistan and others (2007 PLC (CS) 1046), Civil Aviation Authority Vs. Javed Ahmed (2009 SCMR 956) and (2010 PLC (CS) 1360 at 1375 ). 17. Leave was granted by this Court (In Civil Appeal No. 1162 of 2012) against the judgment of the High Court in following terms: - 4. We have heard the learned Advocate Supreme Court for the petitioner and learned Dep uty Attorney -General, the latter relied upon the judgment in the case of Civil Aviation Authority v.

[49] Javed Ahmad (2009 SCMR 956) and stated that in such like cases when a person has been dismissed under the Ordinance of 2000, he can invoke the jurisdiction of the High Court as he cannot be left without any remedy. He relied upon following paragraph from the judgment in the case of Javed Ahmed (supra): -- "8.

[50] Needless to mention here that FBR through Circular No.7 dated l9th July, 2008 clarified that scheme is applicable to all undisclosed assets/income which somehow or the other could not be disclosed and remained unexplained and that cases are pending in appeal or raised/detected by the department would be dealt under normal law and not under specific provi sions of scheme.

[51] The second deviation took place when the FBR issued Circular No.8 of 2008 whereby the scheme was restricted so as to exclude pending cases before the department, appellate authority or any Court, thus, the state of law was changed. We are of the view that amendment brought through the referred circular is of substantive nature thereby restricting the scope of the original scheme and the state of law stood changed from the said date effecting the right and liabilities of those who have acted upon the scheme in good faith under its original scope.

[52] Therefore, Circular No.8 of 2008 cannot apply retrospectively and show -cause notices stand vacated. CIVIL APPEAL NOs. , , , 142 -K/2009, 177 - K/2010, 178 -K/2010, 228 -K/2010, 57 -K/2011, 63 -K/2011, 65 -K/2011, 66 - K/2011, 83 -K/2011, 91 -K/2011, 135 -K/2011, 136 -K/2011, 137 -K/2011, 188 - K/2011, 232 -K/2011, 75 -K/2012 AND 82-K/2012 16 5.

[53] It is pertinent to mention here that besides the above judgment, in another case i.e. Hyderabad Electric Supply Company v. Mushtaq Ali Brohi (2010 PSC 1392), this Court has held that as the services of the respondent were not governed by the statutory rules, therefore, the High Court had no jurisdiction to entertain the petition under Article 199 of the Constitution.

[54] It may not be out of context to note that in another case reported as Executive Council Allama Iqbal Open University v. M. Tufail Hashmi (2010 SCMR 1484), this Court in its paragraph No.9 observed as under: -- 9. The principle per ceived from the above judgments is that the employees of those organizations, which are discharging functions in connection with the affairs of Federation, can approach the learned High Court under Article 199 of the Constitution but subject to the conditi on if their services are protected under the statutory rules." 6.

[55] As far as the jurisdiction of the Tribunal under Article 212 of the Constitution is concerned, it was opined that the Tribunal would have jurisdiction under Article 212 of the Constitution for redressal of grievance of those employees whose terms and conditions are governed under the statutory rules.

[56] Admittedly, terms and conditions of the respondent in the present case have not been settled under the Constitutional provision referred to her einbefore, therefore, inter alia, the question for consideration would be as to whether, if a person being employee of a corporation like Steel Mills has been proceeded against under the provisions of Ordinance of 2000, would he have no remedy to challenge such order. 7.

[57] Leave to appeal is granted, inter alia, to examine the above questions and to resolve the divergent opinions in the judgments noted hereinabove. Office is directed to put up a note for the purpose of constituting larger Bench to set at naug ht these discrepancies in the judgments noted above.” CIVIL APPEAL NOs. , , , 142 -K/2009, 177 - K/2010, 178 -K/2010, 228 -K/2010, 57 -K/2011, 63 -K/2011, 65 -K/2011, 66 - K/2011, 83 -K/2011, 91 -K/2011, 135 -K/2011, 136 -K/2011, 137 -K/2011, 188 - K/2011, 232 -K/2011, 75 -K/2012 AND 82-K/2012 17 18.

[58] Having considered the submissions made by learned counsel for the parties and having gone through the precedent case law cited at the bar as also the conflict of opinion reflected in the leave grantin g order, the questions which crop up for consideration broadly would be as follows :- (i) Whether the appellants are persons discharging functions in connection with affairs of Federation or a Province within the meaning of clause (5) of Article 199 of the Cons titution and amenable to writ jurisdiction of the High Court? and (ii) Whether the respondent -employees being ‘person in corporation service’ within the meaning of section 2(c) of the Removal from Service (Special Powers) Ordinance, 2000 and having been deprive d of their right to appeal by a judgment of this Court in Mubeen us Islam’s case (PLD 2006 SC 602), could invoke Article 199 of the Constitution against the order of the departmental authority in view of the law laid down by this Court in Civil Aviation Au thority through Director General v.

[59] Javed Ahmad and another (2009 SCMR 956) or their remedy is a claim of damages as held in Pakistan International Airline Corporation Vs. Tanweer -ur-Rehman (PLD 2010 SC 676), Executive Council, Allama Iqbal Open University , Islamabad through Chairman and another v. M.

[61] Javed Ahmad (2009 SCMR 956)? Questions of Law and Opinion of the Court: Question No.1: Whether the appellants are persons discharging functions in connection with affairs of Federation or a Province within the meaning of clause (5) of Article 199 of the Constitution and amenable to writ jurisdiction of the High Court? 19.

[62] To better appreciate the question mooted above, it would be of relevance to give a brief overview of the law , structure and functions of the statutory bodies/corporations/authorities (appellants). (i) Pakistan Steel Mills Pakistan Steel Mills is admittedly a public sector project. It was established in July 1968 under the Companies Act, 1913 as a private limited company.

[63] It is not denied that the Federal Government makes appointments in the top management of the Mills and plays a pivotal role in its policy making. Though it is not a statutory body, but its employees are “persons in corporation service” within the scope of section 2(c) of the Ordinance, 2000. Admittedly, their disciplinary matters were being regulated by a statutory regime (the Ordinance 2000) and they had sought enforcement of the said regime/statutory intervention when the said regime was in the field by invoking Article 199(1)(a)(ii) of the Constitution as they had been deprived of their right to appeal.

[64] CIVIL APPEAL NOs. , , , 142 -K/2009, 177 - K/2010, 178 -K/2010, 228 -K/2010, 57 -K/2011, 63 -K/2011, 65 -K/2011, 66 - K/2011, 83 -K/2011, 91 -K/2011, 135 -K/2011, 136 -K/2011, 137 -K/2011, 188 - K/2011, 232 -K/2011, 75 -K/2012 AND 82-K/2012 19 (ii) Port Qasim Authority: Port Qasim Authority is a statutory body created under the Ports Qasim Authority Act, 1973.

[65] A bare reading of various provisions of this Act would indicate that in its management and functions the Federal Government has effective control. The G overnment by notification in the Official Gazette defines the limits of the Port Qasim Authority (Section 3); the management of the Authority is carried out by the Board comprising of at least three and not more than seven members including the Chairman to be appointed by the Federal Government (Section 6); the Board is guided on policy mattes by directions issued by the Federal Government from time to time [(Section 5(2)]; the remuneration and conditions of service of the Chairman and Members of the Board are determined by the Federal Government (section 7); all schemes under the Act are to be prepared in such manner and form as the Federal Government may specify (section 12); the Authority is mandated to frame scale of tolls, dues, rates and charges, annua l or other, to be paid by the owners of vessels.

[66] Such scales are to be published in the Official Gazette after approval by the Federal Government [Section 12 (3) (4)]; the Federal Government has the power to exempt any goods or class of goods from operatio n of the charging section (Section 20(3); the Authority has the power to acquire land within the Board Area (Section 34); the Chairman, members, officers and servants of the Authority when acting under the Act are deemed to be public servants within the me aning of section 21 of the Pakistan Penal Code (Section 52).

[67] CIVIL APPEAL NOs. , , , 142 -K/2009, 177 - K/2010, 178 -K/2010, 228 -K/2010, 57 -K/2011, 63 -K/2011, 65 -K/2011, 66 - K/2011, 83 -K/2011, 91 -K/2011, 135 -K/2011, 136 -K/2011, 137 -K/2011, 188 - K/2011, 232 -K/2011, 75 -K/2012 AND 82-K/2012 20 Thus the composition and functions as given in various provisions of the Statute to which reference has been made above indicate that: first the Federal Government has an overriding role in the appointment of the Chairman and members of the Board, in policy making and even in charging provisions and with regard to powers of land acquisition.

[68] Second the functions and powers it exercise have some elements of public authority. The Authority therefo re can be classified as a ‘person’ performing functions in connection with the affairs of the Federation within the meanings of Article 199(1)(a)(ii) read with Article 199(5) of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan. iii) S.M.E.

[69] Bank: S.M.E. Ba nk is established under the Regional Development Finance Corporation and Small Business Finance Corporation (Amalgamation and Conversion) Ordinance, 2001 (Ordinance LVI of 2001). Its employees would come within the purview of the Ordinance 2000, section 2( c) of which defines ‘person in corporation service’ as “every person in the employment of a corporation, corporate body, authority, statutory body or other organization or institutions set up, established, owned, managed or controlled by the Federal Govern ment, or by or under any law for the time being in force or a body or organization in which the Federal Government has a controlling share or interest and includes the Chairman and the Managing Director, and the holder of any other office therein.” It was on account of the above mandate of law that CIVIL APPEAL NOs. , , , 142 -K/2009, 177 - K/2010, 178 -K/2010, 228 -K/2010, 57 -K/2011, 63 -K/2011, 65 -K/2011, 66 - K/2011, 83 -K/2011, 91 -K/2011, 135 -K/2011, 136 -K/2011, 137 -K/2011, 188 - K/2011, 232 -K/2011, 75 -K/2012 AND 82-K/2012 21 admittedly its respondent -employees were proceeded against this Ordinance. iv) Defence Housing Authority, Karachi: The Defence Housing Authority Karachi was established under the Pakistan Defence Officers Housin g Authority Order, 1980 (promulgated on 9th of August 1980).

[70] The management and authority vests in the Governing Body which comprises of the Secretary -General, Ministry of Defence, Government of Pakistan, who would be its Chairman and the other members/off icers include (a) Vice Chiefs of Staff of the three Services or one Principal Staff Officer from each of the three Services to be nominated by the respective Chiefs of Staff; (b) the President; (c) the Director, Military Lands and Cantonments; and (d) the Administrator [(Section 5 (1)].

[71] For day to day working, an Executive Board of the Authority comprises of Corps Commander who would be its President and other members include: (a) a serving Naval Officer not below the rank of a Commodore posted at Karachi, to be nominated by the Chief of the Naval Staff; (b) a serving Air Force officer not below the rank of an Air Commodore posted at Karachi, to be nominated by the Chief of the Air Staff; (c) a serving Army Officer not below the rank of a Brigadier posted at Karachi, to be nominated by the Chief of the Army Staff; (d) the Administrator; and (e) co -opted members, to be appointed by the Executive Board for a period not exceeding two years at a time, provided that such co -opted members shall not have any right o f vote. [(Section 5(2)].

[72] The Executive Board of the Authority has the CIVIL APPEAL NOs. , , , 142 -K/2009, 177 - K/2010, 178 -K/2010, 228 -K/2010, 57 -K/2011, 63 -K/2011, 65 -K/2011, 66 - K/2011, 83 -K/2011, 91 -K/2011, 135 -K/2011, 136 -K/2011, 137 -K/2011, 188 - K/2011, 232 -K/2011, 75 -K/2012 AND 82-K/2012 22 power to acquire land under the law, undertake any work in pursuance of any scheme or project; no master plan, planning or development scheme can be prepared by any local body or agency for the specified area without prior consultation with, and approval of, the Executive Board (Section 9).

[73] The Authority through the Executive Board has the power to raise funds for the purpose of its working capital in a manner the Board may think proper, through loans or levy of any charges which may be prescribed by it under the Rules (Section 10). The Administrator functions in accordance with the policy laid down by the Governing Body (Section 11).

[74] All schemes/projects/works carried out by the Authority are deemed under the law to be schemes for public purposes (section 12). The employees of the Authority are deemed to be public servants within the meaning of section 21 of the Pakistan Penal Code (Section 16). The Governing Body has the power to make Rul es by notification in the Official Gazette for carrying out the purposes of the Order/Statute. (Section 22).

[75] The Executive Board has the power to make Regulations not inconsistent with the provisions of the Order and the rules as it may consider necessary or expedient for the administration and management of the affairs of the Authority. (Section 23). In Civil Appeal Nos. 1150 and 228 -K of 2010, respondents were employees of Pakistan International Airlines Corporation.

[76] In Civil Appeal No. 117 -K of 2010, r espondents were employees of Housing Building Finance Corporation. In Civil Appeal No. 142 -K of 2009, respondents were employees of N.E.D. University. In Civil Appeal No. 188 -K of 2011, respondents were CIVIL APPEAL NOs. , , , 142 -K/2009, 177 - K/2010, 178 -K/2010, 228 -K/2010, 57 -K/2011, 63 -K/2011, 65 -K/2011, 66 - K/2011, 83 -K/2011, 91 -K/2011, 135 -K/2011, 136 -K/2011, 137 -K/2011, 188 - K/2011, 232 -K/2011, 75 -K/2012 AND 82-K/2012 23 employees of Pakistan State Oil.

[77] All these employees were proceeded against under the Ordinance, 2000 and were awarded various penalties. The learned High Court decided the question of jurisdiction holding that writ was maintainable as the appellants were “persons” within the meaning of Article 199(5) of the Constitution and further that respondent -employees had no alternate remedy as their right of appeal under section 10 of the Ordinance had been declared to be ultra vires of the Constitution. 20.

[78] While dilating on this question whether the appellants - organizat ions are “persons” within the meanings of Article 199(1)(a)(ii) read with Article 199(5) of the Constitution, the expanded functions of the Federation or a Province in contemporary age have to be kept in view. An important dimension of the modern welfare S tate is that the role of the State and its various institutions has increased manifold.

[79] The government is regulator and dispenser of special services. It has the power to create jobs, issue licenses, fix quotas, grant mining rights or lease of estate, sign contracts and provide variety of utility services to the people. Such entrepreneurial activities at times are carried out through companies created under the Statute or under the Companies Ordinance.

[80] The functions these companies / institutions perform ha ve elements of public authority. A public authority is a body which has public or statutory duties to perform and which performs those duties and carries out its transactions for the benefit of the public and not for private gain or profit. Such an authori ty, however is not precluded from making a profit for the public benefit.

[81] The Courts have generally applied what has been CIVIL APPEAL NOs. , , , 142 -K/2009, 177 - K/2010, 178 -K/2010, 228 -K/2010, 57 -K/2011, 63 -K/2011, 65 -K/2011, 66 - K/2011, 83 -K/2011, 91 -K/2011, 135 -K/2011, 136 -K/2011, 137 -K/2011, 188 - K/2011, 232 -K/2011, 75 -K/2012 AND 82-K/2012 24 classified as a “function test” to consider whether a statutory body is a ‘person’ within the meaning of Article 199 of the Constituti on.

[82] In Salahuddin v. Frontier Sugar Mills & Distillery Ltd (PLD 1975 SC 244), the Court laid down similar test to assess whether a body or authority is a person within the meaning of Article 199 of the Constitution and observed: - “The primary test must alw ays be whether the functions entrusted to the organization or person concerned are indeed functions of the State involving some exercise of sovereign or public power; whether the control of the organization vests in a substantial manner in the hands of Government; and whether the bulk of the funds is provided by the State.

[83] If these conditions are fulfilled, then the person, including a body politic or body corporate, may indeed be regarded as a person performing functions in connection with the affairs of t he Federation or a Province; otherwise not.” 21. The afore -referred view was further affirmed in Aitchison College, Lahore through Principal v.

[84] Muhammad Zubair (PLD 2002 SC 326), and while not interfering with the judgment of the Lahore High Court whereby th e latter court had held that the said college was amenable to the jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 199 of the Constitution, this Court laid down as follows: - “Applying the above test on the facts of instant cases, we feel no hesitation in drawi ng inference that the Board of Governors, Aitchison College, Lahore headed by the Governor of the Province as its President along with other officers i.e.

[85] Secretaries Education, Finance and General Officer Commanding as well as unofficial Members are invol ved in providing education which is one of the responsibility of the State and by taking over its management and control the Board, exercises sovereign powers as well as public powers being a statutory functionary of CIVIL APPEAL NOs. , , , 142 -K/2009, 177 - K/2010, 178 -K/2010, 228 -K/2010, 57 -K/2011, 63 -K/2011, 65 -K/2011, 66 - K/2011, 83 -K/2011, 91 -K/2011, 135 -K/2011, 136 -K/2011, 137 -K/2011, 188 - K/2011, 232 -K/2011, 75 -K/2012 AND 82-K/2012 25 Government who in order to provide it f ull legal/Constitutional protection had brought it into the folds of its Education Department by amending the Provincial Rules of Business as back as in 1994 and even if for sake of arguments if it is presumed that no financial aid is being provided to the College from the Provincial Public exchequer, even then, the College remains in dominating control of the Provincial Government through Board of Governors.

[86] Therefore, the above test stands fully satisfied and we are persuaded to hold that organization of the Aitchison College, Lahore falls within the definition of a person.” 22. In Pakistan International Airlines v. Tanweer -ur- Rehman (PLD 2010 SC 676), reiterating the earlier view, the Court laid down a similar three pronged test: (i) whether the functions entrus ted to the organization or person concerned are indeed functions of the State involving some exercise of sovereign or public power; (ii) whether the control of the organization vests in a substantial manner in the hands of Government; and (iii) whether the bulk of funds is provided by the State. 23.

[87] A comparative study of constitutional law on issues under consideration would be instructive. In Sukh Dev Singh and others v. Beghatram Sardar Singh Raghwamshi and another (AIR 1975 SC 1331), the questions mooted before th e Court were inter alia whether action of a statutory corporation in derogation to its Rules could be annulled in writ jurisdiction and whether the Rules framed by the corporation under the Statute were statutory.

[88] The Court held as follows: - "33. ………. A reg ulation framed under a statute applies uniform treatment to every one or to all members of same group or class.. The' Oil and CIVIL APPEAL NOs. , , , 142 -K/2009, 177 - K/2010, 178 -K/2010, 228 -K/2010, 57 -K/2011, 63 -K/2011, 65 -K/2011, 66 - K/2011, 83 -K/2011, 91 -K/2011, 135 -K/2011, 136 -K/2011, 137 -K/2011, 188 - K/2011, 232 -K/2011, 75 -K/2012 AND 82-K/2012 26 Natural Gas Commission, the Life Insurance Corporation and Industrial Finance corporation are all required by the statute to frame regulations, inter alia, for the purpose of the duties and conduct and conditions of service of officers and other employees.

[89] These regulations impose obligation on the statutory authorities. The statutory authorities cannot deviate from the conditions of service. Any deviation will be enforced by legal sanction of declaration by Courts to invalidate actions in violation of rules and regulations under statute is to ensure regular conduct with a distinctive attitude to that conduct as a standard.

[90] The regula tions in the cases under consideration give the employees a statutory status and impose restriction on the employer and the employee with no option. to vary the conditions. An ordinary individual in a case of master and servant contractual relationship enforces breach of contractual terms.

[91] The remedy in such contractual .relationship of master and servant is damages because personal service is not capable of enforcement. In cases of statutory bodies, there is no personal element whatsoever because of the im personal character of statutory bodies. In the case of statutory bodies it has been' said that the element of public employment or service and the support of statute require observance of rules and regulations.

[92] Failure to observe requirements by statutory bodies is enforced by Courts by declaring dismissal in violation of rules and regulations to be valid. This Court has repeatedly observed that whenever a man's rights are affected by decision taken under statutory powers, the Court would presume the existe nce of a duty to observe the rules of natural justice and compliance with rules and regulations imposed by statute. " 24.

[93] Somewhat similar view was taken by this Court in The Evacuee Trust Property Board and another v. Muhammad Nawaz (1983 SCMR 1275) and the judgment of this Court in C.P.S.L.A. No.  titled as Chairman Evacuee Trust Property Board Lahore, etc., v. Noor Elahi and C.P.L.S.A. No. , titled as Chairman Evacuee Trust Property Board Lahore, etc v.

[95] This Court held: - "It appears from the order passed by the learned Chief Justice of the High Court on the two Constitution Petitions that the Board at its 6th Meeting held in May 1969, passed the following resol ution :‑‑ "Agreed. Central Government Rules would apply to the Board's employees for all intents and purposes." Under paragraph 43 of the scheme the Board is authorized to make rules to carry out the; purposes of the scheme framed under section 16‑A(i) of the D isplaced Persons (Compensation and Rehabilitat ion) Act 1958, and under section 14(2) of the Displaced Persons (Land Settlement) Act 1958.

[96] Paragraph 16 of the Scheme provides that no employee of the Board shall be dismissed or otherwise punished except in a ccordance with the rules framed by the Board and approved by the Central Government. In our opinion the aforesaid resolution amounted to making of the rules by the Board.” It was not disputed before the learned Chief Justice that till such time the Board framed its own rules, the employees were governed by the Efficiency and Discipline Rules 1960, framed by the Central Government.

[97] Admittedly these rules were not followed in the cases of the two respondents and, therefore, no fault can be found with the im pugned orders of the learned Chief Justice. Both the petitions are accordingly dismissed." 25. The Court further candidly held, “Even otherwise it is well‑settled that where statutory rules govern the service conditions of an employee, then the pleasure of the master stands sur rendered to the extent the matter is covered by the relevant rules ”. 26.

[98] Whether a company or authority is an instrumentality of the Sta te has also been subject of debate in constitutional CIVIL APPEAL NOs. , , , 142 -K/2009, 177 - K/2010, 178 -K/2010, 228 -K/2010, 57 -K/2011, 63 -K/2011, 65 -K/2011, 66 - K/2011, 83 -K/2011, 91 -K/2011, 135 -K/2011, 136 -K/2011, 137 -K/2011, 188 - K/2011, 232 -K/2011, 75 -K/2012 AND 82-K/2012 28 jurisprudence of India.

[99] The Indian Supreme Court in Ramana v. I.A. Authority of India (AIR 1979 SC 1628) adverting to the factors which make a corporation or authority an instrumentality of the State hel d:- “It will thus be seen that there are several factors which may have to be considered in determining whether a corporation is an agency or instrumentality of Government.

[100] We have referred to some of these factors and they may be summarized as under: Whet her there is any financial assistance given by the State, and if so, what is the magnitude of such assistance whether there is any other form of assistance, given by the State, and if so, whether it is of the usual kind or it is extraordinary, whether ther e is any control of the management and policies of the corporation by the State and what is the nature and extent of such control, whether the corporation enjoys State conferred or State protected monopoly status and whether the functions carried out by th e corporation are public functions closely related to Governmental functions.

[101] This particularization relevant factors is, however, not exhaustive and by its very nature it cannot be because with increasing assumption of new tasks, growing complexities of management and administration and the necessity of continuing adjustment in relations between the corporation and Government calling for flexibility, adaptability and innovative skills, it is not possible to make an exhaustive enumeration of the tests which would invariably and in all cases provide an unfailing answer to the question whether a corporation is Government instrumentality or agency.

[102] Moreover, even amongst these factors which we have described, no one single factor will yield a satisfactory answe r to the question and the Court will have to consider the cumulative effect of these various factors and arrive at its decision on the basis of a particularized inquiry into the facts and circumstances of each case. ‘The dispositive question in any State a ction case’, as pointed out by Dougles, J., in Jackson v.

[103] Matropolitan Edison Co. (1974) 419 US 345 (supra) is not whether any single fact or relationship presents a sufficient degree of State involvement, but rather whether the aggregate of all relevant f actors compels a finding of State responsibility. It is not enough to CIVIL APPEAL NOs. , , , 142 -K/2009, 177 - K/2010, 178 -K/2010, 228 -K/2010, 57 -K/2011, 63 -K/2011, 65 -K/2011, 66 - K/2011, 83 -K/2011, 91 -K/2011, 135 -K/2011, 136 -K/2011, 137 -K/2011, 188 - K/2011, 232 -K/2011, 75 -K/2012 AND 82-K/2012 29 examine seiatim each of the factors upon which a corporation is claimed to be an instrumentality or agency of Government and to dismiss each individually as being insufficient to support a finding to that effect.

[104] It is the aggregate or cumulative effect of all the relevant factors that is controlling.” 27. Keeping in view the Statutes which established and the functions of the appellants’ authorities, and having considered in the light of “ function test”, we hold and declare that these are statutory bodies, performing some of the functions which are functions of the Federation/State and through the exercise of public power, these bodies create public employments.

[105] These bodies are therefore “ persons” within the meanings of Article 199(1)(a)(ii) read with Article 199(5) of the Constitution. If their actions or orders passed are violative of the Statute creating those bodies or of Rules/Regulations framed under the Statute, the same could be int erfered with by the High Court under Article 199 of the Constitution.

[106] Question No.2: Whether the respondent -employees being ‘person in corporation service’ within the meaning of section 2(c) of the Removal from Service (Special Powers) Ordinance, 2000 and having been deprived of their right to appeal by a judgment of this Court in Mubeen us Islam’s case (PLD 2006 SC 602), could invoke Article 199 of the Constitution against the order of the departmental authority in view of the law laid down by this Court i n Civil Aviation Authority through Director General v.

[109] Javed Ahmad (2009 SCMR 956)? 28. For a better appreciation of the question framed, it would be pertinent to comprehend the ambit and scope of the Ordinance 2000 and its various provisions. It has not been disputed before this Court that the appellants are statutory bodies within the mean ing of section 2 of the Ordinance and that is why all the respondent -employees were proceeded against under the said law except those of NED University and regarding that the High Court of Sindh vide the impugned judgment had observed that those employees too ought to have been dealt with under the said Ordinance.

[110] To discern that the Ordinance 2000 has an overriding effect a reference to certain provisions at this stage would be in order. Section 1(4) of the Ordinance 2000 stipulates that “ it shall apply to persons in Government service and corporation service.” The expression “person in corporation service” has been defined in section 2(c) which reads as under: - “2.

[111] Definitions. --- ---- (a)----- (aa) ------ (b)------ (c)'person in corporation service' mea ns every person in the employment of a corporation, corporate body, authority, statutory body or other organization or institutions set up, established, owned, managed or controlled by the Federal Government, or by or under any law for the time being in fo rce or a body or organization in which the Federal Government has a controlling share or interest and includes CIVIL APPEAL NOs. , , , 142 -K/2009, 177 - K/2010, 178 -K/2010, 228 -K/2010, 57 -K/2011, 63 -K/2011, 65 -K/2011, 66 - K/2011, 83 -K/2011, 91 -K/2011, 135 -K/2011, 136 -K/2011, 137 -K/2011, 188 - K/2011, 232 -K/2011, 75 -K/2012 AND 82-K/2012 31 the Chairman and the Managing Director, and the holder of any other office therein . (d) ----- ” 29.

[112] The right of appeal given under section 10 of the Ordinance (before the Service Tribunal) was held to be ultra vires in view of the law laid down in Mubeen -us-Salam’s case (PLD 2006 SC 602). To further buttress its overriding effect, Section 12 of the Ordinance 2000 provided: - “Proceedings under this Ordinance. - All proceedings initiated on the commencement of this Ordinance in respect of matters and persons in service provided for in this Ordinance shall be governed by the provisions of this Ordinance and rules made thereunder.

[113] Provided that the Fede ral Government may, by notification in the official Gazette, exempt any class or classes of employees of a Corporation, a corporate body, authority, statutory body or other organization or institution set up, established, owned, managed or controlling shar e or interest from the provisions of this Ordinance and such class or classes of employees shall, notwithstanding anything contained in this Ordinance, be proceeded against and dealt with under the laws and rules applicable to such employees before the com mencement of this Ordinance. ” 30.

[114] This Ordinance was promulgated on 27th of May 2000 and remained in force till its repeal on 6th of March, 2010. 31. The expression ‘person in corporation service’ appearing in section 2(c) of the Ordinance 2000 is fairly compreh ensive and indicates that the legislative intent was that every person in the service of a corporation, a corporate body, authority, statutory body or other organization or institution which is established, owned and managed or controlled by the Federal Government or under any law for the time being in force in which CIVIL APPEAL NOs. , , , 142 -K/2009, 177 - K/2010, 178 -K/2010, 228 -K/2010, 57 -K/2011, 63 -K/2011, 65 -K/2011, 66 - K/2011, 83 -K/2011, 91 -K/2011, 135 -K/2011, 136 -K/2011, 137 -K/2011, 188 - K/2011, 232 -K/2011, 75 -K/2012 AND 82-K/2012 32 the Federal Government has a controlling share shall be treated as a “person in corporation service”.

[115] Section 12 mandates that proceedings in service matters against the employees of such statu tory bodies/organizations shall be governed by the provisions of the Ordinance 2000. However, it carries a rider i.e. unless, “the Federal Government may, by notification in the official Gazette, exempt any class or classes of employees of a Corporation, a corporate body, authority ” as defined in section 2(c) from the provisions of this Ordinance and the said notification further provides that those employees would, “ be proceeded against and dealt with under the laws and rules applicable to such employees before the commencement of this Ordinance ”.

[116] It has never been the case of the appellant -organizations before this Court that the Federal Government had in this regard issued any notification in the Official Gazette exempting the respondent -employees from th e provision s of Ordinance 2000. Hence the matters of their service discipline had to be dealt with under the said Ordinance. 32.

[117] Before we proceed to discuss the issue raised, a brief reference to the precedent case law in writ jurisdiction with regard to the employees of statutory bodies generally would be relevant. 33. The actions of statutory bodies in service matters have been subject of judicial scrutiny in all jurisdictions.

[118] In some cases, Courts have interfered in exercise of the power of judicial review on a variety of grounds, while in others they have refrained invoking the principle of Master and Servant. There is need to discern the principles which have weighed with the Courts in varied situations . In Maloch Vs. Aberdeen Corporation (1971) 1 W.L.R. 157 8 Lord CIVIL APPEAL NOs. , , , 142 -K/2009, 177 - K/2010, 178 -K/2010, 228 -K/2010, 57 -K/2011, 63 -K/2011, 65 -K/2011, 66 - K/2011, 83 -K/2011, 91 -K/2011, 135 -K/2011, 136 -K/2011, 137 -K/2011, 188 - K/2011, 232 -K/2011, 75 -K/2012 AND 82-K/2012 33 Wilberforce, in speaking about the anomaly created by judicial decision in the area of contractual and statutory employments narrowed down the parameters of ‘pure master and servant cases’ in observing :- “A comparative list of situations in which persons have been held entitled or not entitled to a hearing or to observation of rules of natural justice, according to the master and servant test, looks illogical and even bizarre.

[119] A specialist surgeon was denied protection which is given to a hospital d octor; a University professor, as a servant has been denied the right to be heard, a dock labourer and an undergraduate have been granted it; examples can be multiplied. One may accept that if there are relationships in which all requirements of the observ ance of rules of natural justice are excluded (and I do not wish to assume that this is inevitably so ), these must be confined to what have been called “pure master and servant cases”, which I take to mean cases in which there is no element of public emplo yment or service, no support by statue, nothing in the nature of an office or a status which is capable of protection.

[120] If any of these elements exist, then, in my opinion, whatever the terminology used, and even though in some inter parties aspects the relationship may be called that of master and servant, there may be essential procedural requirements to be observed, and failure to observe them may result in a dismissal being declared to be void. (Emphasis is supplied) I thin k that employment under publ ic corporation of the nature under consideration here is public employment and therefore the employee should have the protection which appertains to public employment. ” 34.

[121] In Viteralli v. Saton (359 US 535 Second Series 1012), the American Supreme Court spe aking through Judge Frankfurter held that the authority is bound to follow the procedure prescribed in law: “An executive agency must be rigorously held to the standards by which it professes its action to CIVIL APPEAL NOs. , , , 142 -K/2009, 177 - K/2010, 178 -K/2010, 228 -K/2010, 57 -K/2011, 63 -K/2011, 65 -K/2011, 66 - K/2011, 83 -K/2011, 91 -K/2011, 135 -K/2011, 136 -K/2011, 137 -K/2011, 188 - K/2011, 232 -K/2011, 75 -K/2012 AND 82-K/2012 34 be judged……Accordingly, if dismissal from employme nt is based on a defined procedure, even though generous beyond the requirements that bind such agency, that procedure must be scrupulously observed……This judicially evolved rule of administrative law is now firmly established and, if I may add, rightly so .

[122] He that takes the procedural sword shall perish with the sword.” 35. In Sukhdev Singh, Oil & Natural Gas Commission, Life Insurance Corporation, Industrial Finance Corporation Employees Associations Vs. Bhagat Ram, Association of Clause II Officers, Shyam Lal, Industrial Finance Corporation (AIR 1975 SC 1331), the questions before the Indian Supreme Court were whether an order for removal from service contrary to regulations framed under the Oil and Natural Gas Commission Act, 1959; the Industrial Finance Corporation Act, 1948; and the Life Insurance Corporation Act, 1956 would enable the employees to a declaration against the statutory corporation of continuance in service or would only give rise to a claim for damages.

[123] Second whether an employee of a stat utory corporation is entitled to claim protection of Articles 14 and 16 against the Corporation . The Court by majority held as follows: - “60. The Oil and Natural Gas Commission is owned by the Government. It is a statutory body and not a company. The Comm ission has the exclusive privilege of extracting petroleum.

[124] The management is by the Government. It can be dissolved only by the Government. …………………………………………….. 67. For the foregoing reasons, we hold that rules and regulations framed by the Oil and Natural Gas Commission, Life Insurance Corporation and the Industrial Finance Corporation have the force of law.

[125] The employees CIVIL APPEAL NOs. , , , 142 -K/2009, 177 - K/2010, 178 -K/2010, 228 -K/2010, 57 -K/2011, 63 -K/2011, 65 -K/2011, 66 - K/2011, 83 -K/2011, 91 -K/2011, 135 -K/2011, 136 -K/2011, 137 -K/2011, 188 - K/2011, 232 -K/2011, 75 -K/2012 AND 82-K/2012 35 of these statutory bodies have a statutory status and they are entitled to declaration of being in employment when their dismissa l or removal is in contravention of statutory provisions.

[126] By way of abundant caution we state that these employees are not servants of the Union or the State. These statutory bodies are “authorities” within the meaning of Article 12 of the Constitution.” 36. In Lt. Col. Shujaddin Ahmad v. Oil & Gas Development Corporation (1971 SCMR 566), the question mooted was whether the Oil & Gas Development Corporation was a government department and, if so, whether its employees could challenge the order of departmental authority before the High Court under Article 199 of the Constitution.

[127] The Court while reiterating that relationship between the Corporation and its employees in the said case was that of master and servant dismissed the petition and held as follows: - “The consistent view of this Court therefore has been that the employees of such statutory Corporations do not acquire the status of Government servants nor are the guarantees given by the Constitution applicable in their case.

[128] The High Court was, therefore, in our view, right in vacating the order of interim injunction, for according to the law of Master and Servant, a contract of service cannot be specifically enforced. It follows, therefore, that no temporary injunction can either be granted in such case. This peti tion is, accordingly dismissed.” This view was further affirmed in Raziuddin v.

[129] Chairman, Pakistan International Airlines Corporation (PLD 1992 SC 531), and while dismissing the appeal of the employees whose services had been terminated by the re spondent , this Court held as follows: - “Even if we are to agree with Mr. Niaz Ahmad Khan's above submission, we cannot hold that CIVIL APPEAL NOs. , , , 142 -K/2009, 177 - K/2010, 178 -K/2010, 228 -K/2010, 57 -K/2011, 63 -K/2011, 65 -K/2011, 66 - K/2011, 83 -K/2011, 91 -K/2011, 135 -K/2011, 136 -K/2011, 137 -K/2011, 188 - K/2011, 232 -K/2011, 75 -K/2012 AND 82-K/2012 36 section 10(2) of the Act is violative of any fundamental rights guaranteed by the Constitution, keeping in view the factum that to the absence of statutory provisions for regulating the relationship of a statutory Corporation and its employees, the relationship is that of Master and Servant.

[130] We may also observe that subsections (2), (3) and (4) of section 10 of the Act have been omitted by the Pakistan International Airlines Corporation (Amendment) Act,. 1989 (Act No.V11 of 1989), gazetted on 2 -11-1989, and therefore, the above subsection (2) of section 10 is no longer on the statute.” 37.

[131] The above rule of master and servant, it may however, be noted, was departed in situations where relationship between a corporation and its employees was regulated by statutory provisions and violation of such provisions was complained of. Thus in Evacuee Trust Property Board v. Muhammad Nawaz (1983 SCMR 1275), the Court upheld the judgment of the High Court by holding that, “ Where statutory rules governed the service conditions of an employee, then the pleasure of the master stands surrendered to the extent the matter was covered by the relevant rule s.” 38.

[132] The afore -referred view was followed in Anwar Hussain v. Agricultural Development Bank of Pakistan (PLD 1984 SC 194) wherein this Court laid down as follows: - “The test of the employer/employee relation is the right of the employer to exercise control of the details and method of performing the work.

[133] It follows that if the relationship is the result of a contract freely entered into by the contracting parties then the principle of Master and Servant will apply. The principle, however, will not apply if some law or statutory rule intervenes and places fetters upon the freedom of the parties in the matter of the terms of the contract.

[134] It is on this principle that a civil servant for whom there are constitutional safeguards, is not governed by the principl e of Master and Servant; for he is possessed of a legal character for the CIVIL APPEAL NOs. , , , 142 -K/2009, 177 - K/2010, 178 -K/2010, 228 -K/2010, 57 -K/2011, 63 -K/2011, 65 -K/2011, 66 - K/2011, 83 -K/2011, 91 -K/2011, 135 -K/2011, 136 -K/2011, 137 -K/2011, 188 - K/2011, 232 -K/2011, 75 -K/2012 AND 82-K/2012 37 enforcement of which he can bring an action.

[135] Even where the employee is not a civil servant but there are statutory safeguards governing his relationship with the employer and placin g restrictions on the freedom of the parties to act, the general law of Master and Servant will not apply. In such cases the employer would be bound to follow the procedure provided for in the statute or the statutory rules before terminating the service o f the employee and in the absence of conformity to such procedure, the termination of service would not be clothed with validity and the employee will be entitled to an action for his reinstatement:" (Emphasis is supplied) 39.

[136] In Principal, Cadet College, Koh at and another v. Mohammad Shoab Qureshi (PLD 1984 SC 170), this Court reiterated the above principle and held as follows: “It is, therefore, evident that where the conditions of service of an employee of a statutory body are governed by statutory rules, a ny action prejudicial taken against him in derogation or in violation of the said rules can be set aside by a writ petition.

[137] However, where his terms and conditions are not governed by statutory rules but only by regulations, instructions or directions, which the institution or body, in which he is employed, has issued for its internal use, any violation thereof will not, normally, be enforced through a writ petition." . 40.

[138] The above principle was reiterated in following cases: - (1) Nisar Ahmad v. The Directo r, Chiltan Ghee Mills 1987 SCMR 1836. (2) National Bank of Pakistan v. Manzoorul Hasan 1989 SCMR 832. (3) Sindh Road Transport Corporation through , its Chairman v. Muhammad Ali G. Khokhar 1990 SCMR 1404. (4) Karachi Development Authority and another v Wali Ahmad Khan and others 1991 SCMR 2434.

[139] CIVIL APPEAL NOs. , , , 142 -K/2009, 177 - K/2010, 178 -K/2010, 228 -K/2010, 57 -K/2011, 63 -K/2011, 65 -K/2011, 66 - K/2011, 83 -K/2011, 91 -K/2011, 135 -K/2011, 136 -K/2011, 137 -K/2011, 188 - K/2011, 232 -K/2011, 75 -K/2012 AND 82-K/2012 38 41. In Karachi Development Authority v. Wali Ahmed Khan (1991 SCMR 2434), this Court did not interfere in the judgment of the High Court under Article 199 of the Constitution whereby the petitions were allowed becaus e the action of the authority was tainted with malice notwithstanding the non- statutory nature of Regulations under which the employee was being governed. 42.

[140] In Mrs. Anisa Rehman v. PIAC and another (1994 SCMR 2232), the scope of judicial review was further enlarged despite Regulations being non -statutory and violation of principles of natural justice was held to be a valid ground to invoke writ jurisdiction under Article 199 of the Constitution . In the said case, the employee was aggrieved of an order of dem otion passed without hearing him and the said right of hearing was not being claimed by him through statutory provision.

[141] This Court nevertheless held that the principles of natural justice were part of law and the order of the authority was struck down. 43. In Walayat Ali Mir v. Pakistan Intl. Airlines Corporation through its Chairman (1995 SCMR 650 ), the Court held that the Corporation was bound by its Regulations though those may be non -statutory and struck down the order of the authority which was violative of those Regulations .

[142] It also laid down parameters of exercise of this discretionary jurisdiction. 44. In Housing Building Finance Corporation through Managing Director, Karachi and another v. Inayatullah Shaikh (1999 SCMR 311), this Court while reiterating th e earlier view that the Corporation may terminate the service of an employee under CIVIL APPEAL NOs. , , , 142 -K/2009, 177 - K/2010, 178 -K/2010, 228 -K/2010, 57 -K/2011, 63 -K/2011, 65 -K/2011, 66 - K/2011, 83 -K/2011, 91 -K/2011, 135 -K/2011, 136 -K/2011, 137 -K/2011, 188 - K/2011, 232 -K/2011, 75 -K/2012 AND 82-K/2012 39 Regulation 11 simplicitor qualified it with a proviso; provided it acts in good faith and in the interest of Corporation .

[143] Though the principle of ‘Master and Servant’, was r eaffirmed, yet the Court did not interfere with the judgment of the High Court whereby the writ petition had been allowed and the employee of the House Building Finance Corporation was reinstated since the order of the competent authority terminating the s ervice of the employee had not been placed before the High Court. 45.

[144] In Pakistan International Airlines Corporation (PIAC) v. Nasir Jamal Malik (2001 SCMR 934), the PIA had challenged the judgment of the Service Tribunal wherein it had allowed respondents -employees’ appeal and directed their reinstatement as their services had been terminated without assigning any reason but it was left to the organization to proceed against them in accordance with law.

[145] This Court upheld the judgment of the Service Tribunal and reiterate d the law laid down in Mrs. Anisa Rehman v. PIAC (1994 SCMR 2232) to the effect that the employees of PIAC were governed by the principle of “Master and Servant” but put a rider that “the employer who itself has framed Rules as well as the Regul ations for its domestic purposes is bound to strictly follow/adhere them because deviation therefrom is bound to violate settled principles of justice including the one enshrined in the maxim Audi alteram partem i.e. no one is to be condemned unheard.” 46.

[146] The violation of principles of natural justice in disciplinary proceedings has been found to be valid ground for CIVIL APPEAL NOs. , , , 142 -K/2009, 177 - K/2010, 178 -K/2010, 228 -K/2010, 57 -K/2011, 63 -K/2011, 65 -K/2011, 66 - K/2011, 83 -K/2011, 91 -K/2011, 135 -K/2011, 136 -K/2011, 137 -K/2011, 188 - K/2011, 232 -K/2011, 75 -K/2012 AND 82-K/2012 40 judicial review in U.K. as well.

[147] In a very instructive Article1 titled ‘Judicial Review of Dismissal from Employment: Coherence or Confusion?’ by Bernadette A. Walsh, with reference to plethora of case law, the author stated that: - “In the context of dismissal from employment, the major significance of the grounds of judicial review is that they enable a dismissed employee to challenge his dismissal on the grounds that the decision to dismiss him was taken in disregard of procedural requirements, including the rules of natural justice, or that it was so unreasonable that no reasonable body could have taken it2.

[148] By contrast, in an ordinary action for wrongful dismissal, the traditional view was that the employee was confined to arguing that there had been a breach of the terms of his contract pertaining to notice3. Ridge v. Baldwin4 established that an office -holder was entitled to challenge his dismis sal on the additional ground that there had been a breach of the rules of natural justice.

[149] Ridge itself concerned an action begun by writ, but there was no argument in the case as to the appropriate procedure for seeking relief.” 47. In Azizullah Memon v. Pr ovince of Sindh (2007 SCMR 229), this Court annulled the order of the departmental authority because notwithstanding the overriding effect of the Removal from Service (Special Powers) Ordinance (Sindh Ordinance IX) of 2004, the said civil servant had not b een dealt with under the said Ordinance .

[150] The Court observed as follows: - “In the presence of express and specific language employed in the Ordinance neither the departmental authorities nor the Tribunal 1 Appeared in Public Law (1989) 131. 2 In C.S.S.U. v. Minister for the Civil Service [1985] A.C. 374, Lord Diplock described the latter ground as “irrationality”.

[151] However, in R. v. Devon County Council, ex parte G. [1988] 3 W.L.R. 49, Lord Donaldson M.R. stated that he preferred the term “unre asonable” to that of “irrational”, because the latter term is widely interpreted as casting doubt on mental capacity. 3 See, e.g. the discussion in Smith and Wood, Industrial Law (1986, 3rd ed.), 199-218. 4 [1964] A.C. 40.

[153] This Court has already ruled in a number of judgments that this Ordinance has the overriding effect over all other laws o n the subject except in case of proceedings, which were already pending before promulgation of the Ordinance. Since the impugned action was initiated and taken to its logical conclusion under a misconception of law and under a wrong law, it has vitiated th e entire proceedings including the final order, which cannot be sustained under the law.

[154] The proceedings as well as final order is, therefore, liable to be set aside.” 48. In Muhammad Dawood and others v. Federation of Pakistan and others (2007 PLC (C.S.)104 6), the High Court of Sindh was seized of the cases of employees of statutory/corporate bodies (including the Civil Aviation Authority, etc.) who had been proceeded against under the Ordinance, 2000 and their appeals before the Service Tribunal were abated which obliged them to challenge the order of the departmental authority in writ jurisdiction.

[155] The Court allowed those petitions and speaking through its Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Sabihuddin Ahmed held as follows: - “From the above somewhat detailed discus sion, we have arrived at the following conclusions: - (i) Irrespective of an employee of a State controlled corporation not being a civil servant the corporation themselves continue to remain amenable to the jurisdiction of this Court under Article 199 of the Constitution. (ii) The rule of master and servant is inapplicable to cases where there is violation of statutory provisions or of any other law.

[156] CIVIL APPEAL NOs. , , , 142 -K/2009, 177 - K/2010, 178 -K/2010, 228 -K/2010, 57 -K/2011, 63 -K/2011, 65 -K/2011, 66 - K/2011, 83 -K/2011, 91 -K/2011, 135 -K/2011, 136 -K/2011, 137 -K/2011, 188 - K/2011, 232 -K/2011, 75 -K/2012 AND 82-K/2012 42 The expression “violation of law” would not be confined merely to violation of any specific provision of a statute but the expression “law”, as observed by Hamoodur Rehman, J., (as his Lordship then was) in Government of West Pakistan v.

[157] Begum Agha Abdul Karim Sorish Kashmiri PLD 1969 SC 14 at page 31 and ought to be considered in its generic sense as connoting all th at is treated as law in this country including even the judicial principles laid down from time to time by the superior Courts. It means according to the accepted norms of legal process and postulates a strict performance of all the functions and duties la id down by law.

[158] It may, for instance, include the principles of natural justice, the public duty to act fairly and honestly and absence of mala fides in fact and law. In all such cases the Court would be competent to grant relief of reinstatement.” 49. While affirming the afore -mentioned judgment of the High Court of Sindh, this Court considered the effect of the Ordinance 2000 qua the jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 199 of the Constitution for the first time in Civil Aviation Authority through Di rector General v.

[159] Javed Ahmad (2009 SCMR 956). The Court observed as under: - ““The learned High Court was fully empowered to consider whether the action complained of is in accordance with the Removal from Service (Special Powers) Ordinance, 2000. Therefor e, the violation of law falls within the parameters of the constitutional jurisdiction and the petition was properly entertainable regarding punishment of compulsory retirement to Javed Ahmed.

[160] The right of individual by change of law cannot be closed as pa st transaction and the constitutional petition remains alive to agitate the rights guaranteed under the Constitution. The departmental action on the statement of allegations contained 23 allegations which include additional allegations, was passed on malic e and pre -determined desire to get rid of Javed CIVIL APPEAL NOs. , , , 142 -K/2009, 177 - K/2010, 178 -K/2010, 228 -K/2010, 57 -K/2011, 63 -K/2011, 65 -K/2011, 66 - K/2011, 83 -K/2011, 91 -K/2011, 135 -K/2011, 136 -K/2011, 137 -K/2011, 188 - K/2011, 232 -K/2011, 75 -K/2012 AND 82-K/2012 43 Ahmed.

[161] After abatement of his service appeal, there was no remedy available under the law in view of Mubeen -us-Salam's case and the petition before the High Court was maintainable” 50. The principles of law whi ch can be deduced from the foregoing survey of the precedent case law can be summarized as under: - (i) Violation of Service Rules or Regulations framed by the Statutory bodies under the powers derived from Statutes in absence of any adequate or efficacious rem edy can be enforced through writ jurisdiction. (ii) Where conditions of service of employees of a statutory body are not regulated by Rules/Regulations framed under the Statute but only Rules or Instructions issued for its internal use, any violation thereof cannot normally be enforced through writ jurisdiction and they would be governed by the principle of ‘Master and Servant’. (iii) In all the public employments created by the Statutory bodies and governed by the Statutory Rules/Regulations and unless those appointm ents are purely contractual, the principles of natural justice cannot be dispensed with in disciplinary proceedings.

[162] CIVIL APPEAL NOs. , , , 142 -K/2009, 177 - K/2010, 178 -K/2010, 228 -K/2010, 57 -K/2011, 63 -K/2011, 65 -K/2011, 66 - K/2011, 83 -K/2011, 91 -K/2011, 135 -K/2011, 136 -K/2011, 137 -K/2011, 188 - K/2011, 232 -K/2011, 75 -K/2012 AND 82-K/2012 44 (iv) Where the action of a statutory authority in a service matter is in disregard of the procedural requirement s and is violative of the princ iples of natural justice, it can be interfered with in writ jurisdiction. (v) That the Removal from Service (Special Powers) Ordinance, 2000 has an overriding effect and after its promulgation (27th of May, 2000), all the disciplinary proceedings which had be en initiated under the said Ordinance and any order passed or action taken in disregard to the said law would be amenable to writ jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 199 of the Constitution. 51.

[163] This brings us to the precedent case law of this Court which reflects the conflict of opinion with regard to remedies available to an employee of a statutory body. As we examine the law, it may be kept in view that prior to Mubeen -us-Salam’s case (PLD 2006 SC 602), there were two remedies available to the employees of the statutory corporations: (i) section 2A of the Service Tribunals Act; and (ii) under section 10 of the Ordinance, 2000.

[164] Section 2A of the Service Tribunals Act, was declared ultra vires of the Constitution and the appeals pending before the Tribunal abated. The effect of section 10 of the Ordinance 2000, however, was not considered by the Court in the said judgment. As discussed in para 4 9 above , the effect of deprivation of right to CIVIL APPEAL NOs. , , , 142 -K/2009, 177 - K/2010, 178 -K/2010, 228 -K/2010, 57 -K/2011, 63 -K/2011, 65 -K/2011, 66 - K/2011, 83 -K/2011, 91 -K/2011, 135 -K/2011, 136 -K/2011, 137 -K/2011, 188 - K/2011, 232 -K/2011, 75 -K/2012 AND 82-K/2012 45 appeal granted under section 10 of the Ordinance, 2000 with reference to remedy under Article 199 of the Constitution was considered for the first time in Civil Aviation Authority v.

[165] Javed Ahmad supra . In the said case , the facts were that an employee of Civil Aviation Authority was proceeded against under the Ordina nce 2000 and awarded major penalty of compulsory retirement. He filed appeal before the Service Tribunal which was directed to have abated by order of the Service Tribunal on account of the judgment of this Court in Mubeen -us-Salam’s case (PLD 2006 SC 602) .

[166] He along with several employees similarly placed challenged the order of departmental authorities before the High Court of Sindh. The petitions were allowed only on question of jurisdiction by a Full Bench of which one of us (Sarmad Jalal Osmany, J.) was a member and it was held that those petitions under Article 199 of the Constitution were competent and were directed to be listed before appropriate Benches of High Court of Sindh for hearing on merit [Muhammad Dawood and others Supra (2007 PLC (C.S.)1046 )].

[167] The Court allowed those petitions in terms as referred to in para 48 above. The said judgment was upheld in Civil Aviation Authority supra (2009 SCMR 956). 52. In Executive Council, Allama Iqbal Open University, Islamabad through Chairman and another v. M. Tufail Hashmi (2010 SCMR 1484) wherein a contra opinion was rendered, this Court was seized of several appeals filed by the employees of statutory bodies against the judgment of the Federal Service Tribunal.

[168] The question mooted in those appeals inter alia was whether the Service Tribunal had jurisdiction to entertain and CIVIL APPEAL NOs. , , , 142 -K/2009, 177 - K/2010, 178 -K/2010, 228 -K/2010, 57 -K/2011, 63 -K/2011, 65 -K/2011, 66 - K/2011, 83 -K/2011, 91 -K/2011, 135 -K/2011, 136 -K/2011, 137 -K/2011, 188 - K/2011, 232 -K/2011, 75 -K/2012 AND 82-K/2012 46 decide appeals in view of the law laid down in Muhammad Mubeen -us-Salam v.

[169] Federation of Pakistan (PLD 2006 SC 62) and Muhammad Idrees v. Agricultural Development Bank of Pakistan (PLD 2007 SC 681). The question of jurisdiction of the High Court under Article 199 of the Constitution was not considered. The Court relying on these two judgments and Pakistan Telecommunication Company Ltd.

[170] V. Muhammad Zahid (2010 SCMR 253) held as under: - “10. Now coming towards the definition of a person in 'corporation service' or a person in 'government service', as defined in section 2(c) and (d) of the RSO, 2000. Such persons can be subjected to the RSO, 2000 but keeping in view the definition of the 'civil servant' under the Civil Servant Act, 1973 as well as the dictum laid down in Muhammad Mubeen -us- Salam's case (ibid), only those employees can approach the Service Tribunal, who fall within the definition of civil servant', holding posts in connection wit h the affairs of the Federation.

[171] As far as the remaining categories of employees, including the contractual ones; are concerned, if they are aggrieved of any adverse action, the Service Tribunal is not the appropriate forum for redressal of their grievance , in view of above conclusion, because it is a forum constituted under Article 212 of the Constitution for the redressal of grievance of those employees, whose terms and conditions are settled under Article 212(1)(a) of the Constitution.

[172] Similarly, any action taken against such persons shall not be questionable before the Service Tribunal as it is not meant to provide a forum to the employees, who se services are governed by non-statutory rules or who do not fall within the definition of a person in 'governm ent service' as defined in section 2(d) of the RSO, 2000.

[173] Admittedly, in the present case the employees of AIOU, SME Bank and Pakistan Steel Mill, who approached the Service Tribunal for redressal of their grievance, were CIVIL APPEAL NOs. , , , 142 -K/2009, 177 - K/2010, 178 -K/2010, 228 -K/2010, 57 -K/2011, 63 -K/2011, 65 -K/2011, 66 - K/2011, 83 -K/2011, 91 -K/2011, 135 -K/2011, 136 -K/2011, 137 -K/2011, 188 - K/2011, 232 -K/2011, 75 -K/2012 AND 82-K/2012 47 not enjoying the protection of sta tutory rules, therefore, the Service Tribunal had no jurisdiction to adjudicate upon such matters and they will be governed by the principle of Master and Servant.” 53.

[174] In Pakistan International Airlines Corporation PLD 2010 SC 676 supra , (taking a contra view) the Court distinguished the case of Anisa Rehman v. PIAC (1994 SCMR 2232) by relying on the case of Justice Khurshid Anwar Bhinder (Supra ). In the latter case, the petitioners who were Judges of the High Court had filed review applications against the judgment of this Court in Sindh High Court Bar Association v.

[175] Federation of Pakistan (PLD 2009 SC 879) wherein the appointment of the then Chief Justice of Pakistan and the entire consultative process leading to their appointments ha d been found to be unco nstitutional and non est . The grievance of the review petitioners was that they had been condemned unheard.

[176] The Court while dismissing their review applications came to the conclusion that there can be exceptions to the principle of natural justice that no one should be condemned unheard. The Court observed as follows: “42.……… Principle of audi alteram partem, at the same time, could not be treated to be of universal nature because before invoking/applying the said principle one had to specify that the perso n against whom action was contemplated to be taken prima facie had a vested right to defend the action and in those cases where the claimant had no basis or entitlement in his favour he would not be entitled to protection of the principles of natural justi ce. "(Nazir Ahmad Panhwar v.

[177] Government of Sindh through Chief Secretary Sindh 2009 PLC (C.S.) 161, Abdul Haque Indhar and others v. Province of Sindh through Secretary Forest, Fisheries and Livestock Department, Karachi and 3 others 2000 SCMR 907 and Abdu l CIVIL APPEAL NOs. , , , 142 -K/2009, 177 - K/2010, 178 -K/2010, 228 -K/2010, 57 -K/2011, 63 -K/2011, 65 -K/2011, 66 - K/2011, 83 -K/2011, 91 -K/2011, 135 -K/2011, 136 -K/2011, 137 -K/2011, 188 - K/2011, 232 -K/2011, 75 -K/2012 AND 82-K/2012 48 Waheed and another v.

[178] Secretary, Ministry of Culture, Sports, Tourism and Youth Affairs, Islamabad and another 2002 SCMR 769). It has been elucidated in the detailed reasoning of the judgment of 31.7.2009 how the order passed by a seven Member Bench of t his Court has been flagrantly violated. Besides that the applicants had no vested right to be heard and furthermore they have acted illegally and in violation of the order of seven Member Bench for obtaining illegal gains and benefits which cannot be ignor ed while examining the principle of `audi alteram Partem'. 54.

[179] The afore -referred justification for dispensing with the principle of natural justice was understandable as there was already in the field a conclusive finding by this Court (Sindh High Court Bar Association’s case PLD 2009 SC 879 supra) qua the nature of the consultative process which culminated in the appointment of those Judges.

[180] But in the instant cases, there was no prior conclusive finding by this Court qua the merits of respondents’ case s in disciplinary proceedings and also with regard to the effect of statutory intervention of the Ordinance, 2000. In Hyderabad Electric Supply Co. v. Mushtaq Ali Brohi (2010 PSC 1392), an employee of Hyderabad Electric Supply Co., had challenged the award of major penalty of dismissal from service under the Ordinance, 2000 in writ jurisdiction which was allowed.

[181] This Court set aside the said judgment holding that since the service regulations were non -statutory, writ was not competent. In this case as well, it was not appreciated that though the Rules/Regulations may be non -statutory but there was statutory intervention in the shape of the Ordinance and the employees had to be dealt with under the said law.

[182] CIVIL APPEAL NOs. , , , 142 -K/2009, 177 - K/2010, 178 -K/2010, 228 -K/2010, 57 -K/2011, 63 -K/2011, 65 -K/2011, 66 - K/2011, 83 -K/2011, 91 -K/2011, 135 -K/2011, 136 -K/2011, 137 -K/2011, 188 - K/2011, 232 -K/2011, 75 -K/2012 AND 82-K/2012 49 55. In an attempt to resolve a conflict of judicial opini on, this Court must keep in mind: first the purpose of law the Court is called upon to interpret; second that law is a living organism which adapts to societal change and sometimes change in law precedes the former; third the ambit of court’s jurisdiction and its limitations as defined in the Constitution; fourth the Court must be consistent i.e. in similar situations/cases, the judicial opinion will be similar; fifth though the Supreme Court is not bound by the principle of stare decisis , but the departure from the precedent should be well reasoned, proper and in accordance with the established principles of law.

[183] A Judge’s role is to interpret the law and to correct its mistakes. The twin role of a developer in law and an earnest interpreter of legislation, though challenging, is in accord with the role the Supreme Court has in the constitutional scheme as also consistent with society’s perceptions of the role of judiciary in a liberal democracy.

[184] In the context of the case in hand, the mandate of two constit utional provisions should be kept in mind i.e. Article 4 and Article 10A which read as follows: - “4. (1) to enjoy the protection of law and to be treated in accordance with law is the inalienable right of every citizen wherever he may be, and of every othe r person for the time being within Pakistan. (2) In particular --- (a) no action detrimental to the life, liberty, body, reputation or property of any person shall be taken except in accordance with law. (b) No person shall be prevented from or be hindered in doin g that which is not prohibited by law; and CIVIL APPEAL NOs. , , , 142 -K/2009, 177 - K/2010, 178 -K/2010, 228 -K/2010, 57 -K/2011, 63 -K/2011, 65 -K/2011, 66 - K/2011, 83 -K/2011, 91 -K/2011, 135 -K/2011, 136 -K/2011, 137 -K/2011, 188 - K/2011, 232 -K/2011, 75 -K/2012 AND 82-K/2012 50 (c) No person shall be compelled to do that which the law does not require him to do. 10A.

[185] For the determination of his civil rights and obligations or in any criminal charge against him a person shall be entitled t o a fair trial and due process.” 56. The legislative intent in the promulgation of Ordinance 2000, inter alia , was that “persons in corporation service” in their service matters should be dealt with in accordance with the provisions of the said law and to en sure a fair deal/trial it was inter alia provided in the Ordinance that unless specifically so exempted by a reasoned order, the competent authority shall hold a regular enquiry against an employee accused of misconduct and that he shall have a right of ap peal (Section 10 of the Ordinance). 57.

[186] The right of appeal is a substantive right. The respondents were deprived of the said right not by any legislative amendment but by a judicial opinion and that too on the analogy of the law laid down in Mubeen us Islam’s case (PLD 2006 SC 602) and Muhammad Idrees’s case (PLD 2007 SC 68) . In both the se cases , the effect of the Ordinance 2000 and that it was a statutory intervention was not a moot point.

[187] It is well established that an appeal is continuation of trial. Would it be a fair trial if an accused is shorn off his right of appeal? Would the deprivation of right of appeal not amount to judicial sanctification of all the orders passed by the departmental authorities awarding various penalties to the employees and would it not be violative of the fundamental right to a “fair trial and due process” as ordained in Article 10A of the Constitution? Could the respondent -employees not invoke CIVIL APPEAL NOs. , , , 142 -K/2009, 177 - K/2010, 178 -K/2010, 228 -K/2010, 57 -K/2011, 63 -K/2011, 65 -K/2011, 66 - K/2011, 83 -K/2011, 91 -K/2011, 135 -K/2011, 136 -K/2011, 137 -K/2011, 188 - K/2011, 232 -K/2011, 75 -K/2012 AND 82-K/2012 51 Article 199 of the Constitution to seek due compliance of the Ordinance 2000 for ensur ing fair trial and due process?

[188] If the constitution al scheme and the purpose of law are kept in view, the answer to all these queries has to be in the affirmative and the constitutional petitions filed by the respondents seeking enforcement of their said r ight would be maintainable. 58. The High Court in the exercise of its jurisdiction under Article 199 of the Constitution can pass an appropriate order “declaring that any act done or proceeding taken within the territorial jurisdiction of the Court by a perso n performing functions in connection with the affairs of the Federation, a Province or a local authority has been done or taken without lawful authority and is of no legal effect.” [(Article 199(1)(a)(ii)] The grievance of the respondent -employees in most of the cases was that the order of the departmental authority was violative of the Ordinance, 2000 and of no legal effect (as they were proceeded against under the said law) while in other cases it was that they had not been dealt with under the said law despite its overriding effect, the High Court had jurisdiction to interfere and allow the petitions. 59.

[189] For what has been discussed above, the cases of this Court reported as (Pakistan International Airlines Corporation PLD 2010 SC 676 , Executive Council Alla ma Iqbal Open University 2010 SCMR 1484 and Hyderabad Electric Supply Co. 2010 PSC 1392 Supra ), we observe with respect, did not declare or enunciate any principle of law but were rendered in their own peculiar facts and circumstances and may not be treat ed as precedent on the issue we are seized of, because :- CIVIL APPEAL NOs. , , , 142 -K/2009, 177 - K/2010, 178 -K/2010, 228 -K/2010, 57 -K/2011, 63 -K/2011, 65 -K/2011, 66 - K/2011, 83 -K/2011, 91 -K/2011, 135 -K/2011, 136 -K/2011, 137 -K/2011, 188 - K/2011, 232 -K/2011, 75 -K/2012 AND 82-K/2012 52 (i) The issue before this Court in Executive Council Allama Iqbal Open University supra was only whether the Service Tribunal had jurisdiction to hear the appeal in view of the law laid down in Mubeen -us-Salam’s case supra and whether the writ jurisdiction under Article 199 of th e Constitution could be invoked in the event of violation of Ordinance, 2000 . (ii) In all the above cases, the point that irrespective of the Rules/Regulations being non -statutory the promulgation of Ordinance 200 0 was a statutory intervention and any violation thereof would b e amenable to writ jurisdiction was not considered.

[190] In Hyderabad Electric Supply Co. 2010 PSC 1392 Supra, there was no allegation that there was any violation of a ny provision of the Ordinance 2000 and enforcement of Service Rules was sought which were found to be non - statutory. (iii) Neither the mandate of Article s 4 and 10A of the Constitution nor t he law laid down in Civil Aviation Authority through Director General v .

[191] Javed Ahmad (2009 SCMR 956) and Azizullah Memon v. Province of Sindh (2007 SCMR 229) was considered in those cases. CIVIL APPEAL NOs. , , , 142 -K/2009, 177 - K/2010, 178 -K/2010, 228 -K/2010, 57 -K/2011, 63 -K/2011, 65 -K/2011, 66 - K/2011, 83 -K/2011, 91 -K/2011, 135 -K/2011, 136 -K/2011, 137 -K/2011, 188 - K/2011, 232 -K/2011, 75 -K/2012 AND 82-K/2012 53 60.

[192] It was not disputed before this Court by appellants’ learned counsel that the respondent -employees were “persons in corporation service” within the meaning of section 2(c) of the Ordinance 2000 and except in the case of N.E.D. University, they were proceeded against under the said law. This was a statutory intervention and the employees had to be dealt with under the said law.

[193] Their discipl inary matters were being regulated by something higher than statutory rules i.e. the law i.e. Ordinance, 2000. Their right of appeal (under section 10) had been held to be ultra vires of the Constitution by this Court as they d id not fall within the ambit of the Civil Servants Act, 1973 , [(in Mubeen us Islam’s case (PLD 2006 SC 602) and Muhammad Idrees’s case (PLD 2007 SC 68)].

[194] They could in these circumstances invoke constitutional jurisdiction under Article 199 of the Constitution to seek enforcement of t heir right guaranteed under Article 4 of the Constitution which inter alia mandates that every citizen shall be dealt with in accordance with law. The judgment of this Court in Civil Aviation Authority (2009 SCMR 956 ) supra is more in consonance with the l aw laid down by this Court and the principle s deduced therefrom as given in Para 50 above. 61.

[195] These are the detailed reasons for our short order dated 2.5.2013 which is reproduced hereinbelow :- “For the reasons to be recorded later in the detailed judgment we are of the view that Removal from Service (Special Powers) Ordinance, 2000 had overriding effect and any violation or non-compliance of the said statute was amenable to writ jurisdiction.

[196] The impugned judgments CIVIL APPEAL NOs. , , , 142 -K/2009, 177 - K/2010, 178 -K/2010, 228 -K/2010, 57 -K/2011, 63 -K/2011, 65 -K/2011, 66 - K/2011, 83 -K/2011, 91 -K/2011, 135 -K/2011, 136 -K/2011, 137 -K/2011, 188 - K/2011, 232 -K/2011, 75 -K/2012 AND 82-K/2012 54 rendered by the High Court on that score are not open to exception.
