[1] judgment dated 09 -8-2019 passed by the High Court of Balochistan, Quetta in Cr l. AppealNo. ) Manzoor Ahmed Akhtar …Petitioner(s) Versus The State …Res pondent (s) For the Petitioner(s): Mr. Manzoor Ahmed Rehmani, ASC For the State : Syed Abdul Baqar Shah, ASC at Islamabad along with Wallayat Hussain Addl.

[2] P.G. Balochistan at Quetta Date of hearing: 09.09.2020. ORDER Qazi Muhammad Amin Ahmed, J. - The petitioner, a Secondary School Teacher, was tried on a criminal charge that resulted into his conviction; guilty verdict , upheld throughout, alongsi de corporal conseq uences risked him his job as well .

[3] After his release, he successfully hoodwinked the department by presenting a fake decision of High Court of Balochistan , purporting to have acquitted him from the charge, as a consequence whereof, he was given posting again in the department with all benefits through condonation of absence period as earned leave .

[4] On an application, the Anti Corruption Department initiated inquiry against the petitioner and co -accused Nazeer, an office Superintendent, blam ed to have facilitated him in betraying the public exchequer. A learned Special Judge acquitted the co-accused by extending him benefit of the doubt, however, convicted and sentenced the petitioner, as under: “U/s 409 PPC, 10-years RI with fine of Rs.80,00 0/- U/s 420 PPC, 7-years RI with fine of Rs.50,000/ - U/s 467 PPC, 10-years RI with fine of Rs.80,000/ - U/s 468 PPC, 7-years RI with fine of Rs.50,000/ - Criminal Petition No.69 -Q of 2019 2 U/s 471 PPC, 7-years RI with fine of Rs.50,000/ - U/s 5(2)47 PCA, 4 -years RI with fine of Rs.50,000/ - The High Court modified the judgment by setting aside petitioner’s conviction under sections 409, 420 & 467 of the Pakistan Penal Code, 1860 , however, maintained the guilty verdict on the remainder charges with addition of conviction under section 466 of the Code ibid vide impugned judgment dated 9 -8-2019, vires whereof, are being assailed on the ground that after prosecution’ s failure on the main charges, the only option available to the High Court was to record clean acquittal .

[5] It is further argued that acquittal of office Superintendent, indicted for being privy to the crime also demolished pros ecution case qua the petitioner as well ; he emphatically disowned the fake judgment . The learned Law Officer, assisted by Syed Abdul Baqar Shah, ASC, has faithfully defended the impugned judgment ; 2.

[6] Heard. Record perused. 3. Petitioner’s prosecution and his conviction on a criminal charge is an admitted position; the judgment on the basis whereof he managed his posting was found fake ; it is on the basis thereof that the petitioner not only manipulated his service but also derived benefit thereof and, thus, his disclaimer regarding the fake judgment merits outright rejection; he cannot disown a fake judgment relating to the case wherein he was tried and convicted an d, thus, being the sole and obvious beneficiary now cannot escape consequences of ill -gotten gains ; his treachery came into the knowledge of the Anti-Corruption Department when the co -villager s laid information of the mischief, paving way for his prosecuti on.

[7] Acquittal of office Superintendent, seemingly out of abundant caution, does not tremor the charge, distinctly and inexorably pointed upon petitioner’ s culpability; he has rightly been convicted and sentence d and the findings recorded by the Courts below have not been found by us as open to any exception.

[8] Petition fails. Leave declined. Judge Judge Islamabad, the 9th September , 2020 Not approved for reporting Azmat /-
