Leave to appeal in respect of a learned Division Bench ’s judgment dated 10th March 2005 of the Lahore High Court , Lahore was granted in the following terms: “Leave to appeal is granted, inter -alia, to examine as to whether in presence of SRO 455( I)/96 dat ed 13.06.1996, the respondents manufacturers of sugar were not liable to pay excise duty if 5% has been exported because this notification was followed by SRO 456(I)/96 of even date whereby under its clause (i), total exemption was granted in respect of th e goods produced or manufactured in Pakistan, whereas its clause (ii) has created an exception qua rate of duty in respect of th e earlier notification SRO 455(I )/96 dated 13.06.1996.” CA 1  2 2.

[3] The Excise Department claims that respondent No.1 is liable to pay excise duty on a certain quantity of sugar manufactured by it for the period 1998 -1999. The dispute turns on the interpretation of certain statutory regulatory orders (“ SROs ”) issued by the Federal Government under section 12A of the Central Excises Act, 1 944 (“the Act ”), which provision is reproduced hereunder: “12A Exemptions. (1) The Federal Government may from time to time, by notification in the official Gazette, exempt subject to such conditions, if any, as may be specified therein, any goods or clas s of goods or any services from the whole or any part of the duty leviable under this Act. (2) The C entral B oard of Revenue may, by special order in each case, exempt from the payment of the whole or any part of the duty leviable under this Act, under cir cumstances of an exceptional nature to be stated, in such order, any goods or services on which such duty is leviable. (3) Any notification or order issued under this section shall be effective from the day specified in the notification or the order, notw ithstanding the fact that the issue of the official Gazette in which such notification appears is published, or the orders is delivered to the person concerned, at any time after that day.” Under section 12A of the Act , the Federal Government from time t o time issued certain exemption s from payment of excise duty in respect of ‘cane sugar ’.

[4] The First Schedule to the Act describes different goods and allocates a code to each one. In this regard the code with regard to ‘cane sugar ’ is 1701.1100. 3. In exercise of its powers under sub section (1) of section 12A of the Act , the Federal Government issued S.R.O. No. 455(I)/96 and S.R.O.

[25] SRO.455(I)/96, dated the 13th June 1996, from the whole of excise duties. TABLE Heading/sub heading number Description of goods and services Rate of duty (1) (2) (3) 1701.1100 Cane Sugar Nil 8. Sheikh Izhar -ul-Haq, the learned counsel for the appellant , contended that even though vi de SRO 456 the rate of duty on cane sugar was brought down to “Nil” however since clause (ii) thereof referred to SRO 455 therefore SRO 456 would not be applicable to cane sugar that was produced as ‘cane sugar ’ was also mentioned in SRO 455.

[26] He further stated that as the respondent No.1 did not export any cane sugar therefore it was liable to pay excise duty on 5% of its total production at the rate of Rs.1.85 per kilogram. 9. Mr. Shakil -ur-Rehman , the learned counsel for respondent No.1 , opposed the appeal and relied upon the judgment of the Hon’ble High Court.

[27] He stated that clause (ii) of SRO 456 has no application to respondent No.1 as it pertains to goods other than those which have been attended to in clause (i) of SRO 456 and since SRO 456 specifically mentioned ‘cane sugar ’ it could not be excluded by reference to clause (ii). The l earned counsel stated that if the interpretation of the appellant’s counsel is accepted then it would render clause (i) of SRO 456 and the Table t herein completely redundant.

[28] He further stated that the Federal Government had consciously brought down the excise duty payable on cane sugar to zero or “ Nil” at the relevant time hence no excise duty can be charge d. Alternatively , the l earned counsel submitted , that CA 1  8 though there is no conflict between the SRO s and within clause s (i) and (ii) of SRO 456, however, even if one is presumed, then as per settled rules of interpretation of fiscal statute s the interpretation favourable to the tax payer (the resp ondent No.1 ) is to be preferred ; reliance was placed upon the cases of Mehran Associates Ltd. v.

[29] Commissioner of Income Tax (1993 PT D 69) and Government of Sind h v. Muhammad Shafi (PLD 2015 Supreme Court 380) . 10. We have carefully gone through the avai lable record with the assistance of the learned counsel, examine d the said SROs and the referred to judgments. 11. The apparent object of SRO 455 was to encourage manufacturers of sugar to export a certain qua ntity of the sugar produced, and if they did so then no excise duty would be payable on it and if they export ed less than the stipulated minimum (which quantity kept varying) they would have to pay excise duty on the quantity which fell below the said minimum quantity of sugar at the prescribed rate (which too kept changing ).

[30] The Federal Government amended SRO 455 four times (on 10.12.1997, 1.4.1998, 23.12.1998 and 21.6.1999) during the relevant period, i.e. 1998 -1999 . The amendments both changed the said minimum qua ntity of sugar as well as the ra te of excise duty thereon. 12. The Federal Government confounded the matter further by the issuance of another SRO (SRO 456) on the very same date as SRO 455 was issued, i.e. 13th June 1996 , and both these SROs stated that they will come into effect on 13th June 1996.

[31] Strangely enough , both the SROs were also in respect of the quantum of excise duty payable on the very same kind of sugar (cane sugar, heading 1701.1100) that was produced. In respect of the same period as mentioned above (1998 -1999) SRO 456 was amended thrice (on 31.3.1998, 16.2.1999 and 21.6.1999).

[32] The last amendment brought down the rate of excise duty to “Nil”, or to put it simply , no excise duty was payable. 13. The High Court, in its appellate jurisdiction under section 36 -C of the Act, set aside the judgment of the Customs, Excise and Sales Tax Tribunal and the order -in- original of the Additional C ollector Adjudication.

[33] The reasoning of the High Court is CA 1  9 given in the penultimate paragraph of the impugned judgment, which is reproduc ed hereunder: “After hearing the learned counsel for the parties we will agree with the learned counsel for the appellant that the latter notification SRO 456(I)/96 was beneficial to the tax payer as manufacturer and since apparently the provisions of two SROs, detailed above, were contradictory which could not be reconciled, the appellant was justified in seeking application and protection of the latter SRO.

[34] The view adopted by the Tribunal, as reproduced above, that general rate of duty on sugar prescribe d under latter SRO was not applicable on the unexported quantity of sugar which was 5% of the total production in the year 1998 -1999 does not appear correct in the case of the appellant as tax payer. All the more -so when the appellant sought application a nd protection of the SRO which though issued on the same day was obviously issued latter in time, which is evident from its number.

[35] It is also an established principle of interpretation of fiscal statutes that when two equally reasonable interpretations o f a provision are possible then the one favourable to the tax payer needs to be adopted. The attempt on the part of the learned Members of the Tribunal to reconcile the two SROs only to find against the tax payer was therefore unjustified.

[36] We are also inf ormed that in a subsequent judgment dated 30.01.2001 the Tribunal in an identical situation in two appeals filed by M/s Humza Sugar Millsa and Layyah Sugar Mills found for the tax payer observing that the appellants having elected to follow SRO 456(I)/96 d ated 13.9.1996 and without exporting any quantity of sugar paid the central excise duty accordingly nothing was due to the department from either of them.” 14.

[37] The aforesaid reasoning of the High Court cannot be faulted. The Federal Government repeatedly amended the SROs and (as noted above) confounded what should have been a relatively simple matter. It could also have resolved the tax matter by issuing unambiguous SRO /s in the matter, but did not do so. Duties and taxes cannot be imposed/charged on th e basis of assumptions or conjecture.

[38] It would be appropriate to reproduce the following extract s from the case s referred to by the learned counsel for the respondent. In the case of Mehran Associates , the judgment which was authored by Ajmal Mian , J. (a s he then was) it was held (at page 8 3E) that: “The cardinal principles of interpretation of a fiscal statute seem to be that all charges upon the subject are to be imposed by clear and unambiguous words.

[39] There is no room for any intendment nor there is any equity of presumption as to a tax. A fiscal provision of a statute is to be construed liberally in favour of the tax -payer and in case of any substantial doubt the same is to be resolved in favour of the citizen.” In the case of Government of Sindh v.

[40] Muhammad Shafi , wherein the judgment was authored by Mian Saqib Nisar , J. it was held (page 387A) as under: “Before resolving the proposition(s) in hand, we may like to mention that the charging section in a fiscal statute, as per the settled law, demands its strict interpretation and application in so far as the CA 1  10 revenue is concerned, but where it is susceptible to two possible interpretations, it should be liberally construed in favour of the tax payer/citizen; particularly, where there is substantial doub t about the true import and application of a charging section, it ( the doubt ) should be resolved in favour of the tax payer/citizen.” 15.

[41] The two SROs contradict each other with regard to the matter of ‘cane sugar’ and the contradiction therein cannot be reconciled. The contention of the learned counsel for the appellant that sub -clause (ii) of SRO 456 would be attracted also does not stand to reason. If for the sake of argument such a contention is accepted then the same clearly conflicts with the inser tion of ‘cane sugar’ in the Table therein and would make the same redundant.

[42] SRO 456 brought down the excise duty to “Nil”, therefore, no excise duty could be chargeable even if the respondent No.1 did not export any sugar in the said period . In the se circumstances the judgment of the High Court does not call for any interference. Consequently, the appeal is dismissed , but with no order as to costs.

[43] We take this opportunity to prevail upon the Federal Government that in exercise of its powers wh ile issuing SROs , the same should be intelligible and must not be open to misinterpretation or to more than one meaning.
