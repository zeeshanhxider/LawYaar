[2] M. Safdar Shaheen Pirzada, ASC Syed Rifaqat Hussain Shah, AOR (in Cr.P.905 -L/201 6) For the State : Mirza M. Usman, Deputy Prosecutor G eneral Punjab Date of hearing: 29.01.2021 . ORDER Qazi Muhammad Amin Ahmed , J. Criminal Petition No.1149 -L of 2017 : Rizwan Ahmed, deceased, 20, alongwith Shakil Masih , injured (PW-2), in the backdrop of an election rivalry, were waylaid within the p recincts of Police Station Tatleyali, District Gujranwala at 9:30 p.m. on 11.2.2006 ; Shahbaz Ahmed (PW -1) lodged report with the police at 10: 30 p.m. wherein the petitioner as well as Qaisar Mehmood and Parvez , supported by two companions, untraced till da te were Criminal Petition No.11 49-L/2017 & Criminal Petition NO.905 -L of 2016 2 arrayed as suspect .

[3] The petitioner, attributed a fatal shot to the deceased, stayed away from law whereas Qaisar Mehmood and Parvez Ahmed co-accused , assigned opening shots to the deceased and Shakil Masih (PW -2), respectively, were tried in his ab sence; convicted for homicide and murderous assault, they were sentenced to imprisonment for life and 10 -years rigorous imprisonment; the former died during pendency of the case whereas the latter served out his sentence , reduced by the High Court .

[4] After a rrest, the petitioner was convicted under clause (b) of section 302 of the Pakistan Penal Code, 1860 , vide judgment dated 13.03.2012 by a learned Addl. Sessions Judge at Gujranwala; he was sentenced to death, alt ered into imprisonment for life vide impugne d judgment dated 08.06.2016 , vires whereof, are being assailed on the grounds that petitioner’s absconsion notwithstanding, there was no occasion for visiting him with a guilty verdict in a night affair with identity issue, looming large on the scene , mere ly on the strength of a misconceived and misplaced suspicion , rooted into a past motive that had long withered away .

[5] It is next argued that inconsequential recovery without any forensic comparison was entirely beside the mark and, thus, in absence of any c orroboration , it was unsafe to place implicit reliance on a flawed ocular account . Learned Law Officer, assisted by counsel for the complainant, has faithfully defended the judgment. 2.

[6] Heard. Record perused. 3. Survival of Shahbaz Ahmed (PW -1) unscathed during the assault , by itself, cannot imply his absence from the scene and as such does not undermine his status as a witness worthy of credence ; a closely related resident of the locality , his encounter with the deceased and the injured in the neighbou rhood, does not raise eyebrows ; steps taken by him after the incident are inconsonance with the investigative details and, thu s, confirmatory to his presence.

[7] A somewhat lengthy cross -examination failed to tremor his testimony, substantially in line with th e ocular account furnished by two other witnesses that included an injured as well ; it squarely constitutes “proof beyond doubt ” , admitting no hypothesis other than petitioner’s guilt whose absence from law for a period exceeding three years does not brilliantly reflect upon his unsupported plea of false implication ; in retrospect, it also indemnifies the impact of inconsequential recovery Criminal Petition No.11 49-L/2017 & Criminal Petition NO.905 -L of 2016 3 of a .30 caliber pistol (P -4), otherwise found consistent with the contour s of the fatal shot .

[8] Available source of li ght vividly shown in the site plan, in the given proximity inter se the parties, the issue of identification , blown out of proportion , least compromises preponderance of overwhelming evidence , inescapably pointed on the culpability of the accused , each judicially taken to the task .

[9] Concurrent conclusions by the courts below , on our own independent analysis, have been found by us , well within the remit of safe administration of criminal justice and, thus, call for no interference. Petition fails. Leave decli ned. Criminal Petition No.905 -L of 2016 Learned counsel for the petitioner seeks withdrawal of this petition.
