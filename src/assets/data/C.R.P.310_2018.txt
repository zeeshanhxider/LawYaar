[3] Faisal Farid, Addl. AG Punjab Rab Nawaz Zahid Director IRI Fazal Hussain, Direc tor Labour Date of Hearing : 07.12 .2020 Judgment Sajjad Ali Shah, J. (CMA ) In view of the fact that Mr. Khalid Anwar, Sr. ASC for the review petitioner was provided an opportunity to address the Court through vide o-link from his Office, therefore, this application seeking permission to argue the case through an alternate counsel has become infructuous and is disposed of accordingly.

[4] CRPs No. 310 & 311 of 2018: The petitioner -Shaheen Airport Service seeks review of para 22 of our judgment dat ed 28.3.2018 which reads as follows: - “22. There is yet another question involved in the matter, namely, the appellant -Shaheen Airport Servic es is a charitable organization or not. It is the case of the appellant that charitable organizations are excluded from the operation of both the federal and provincial law , therefore, regardless of the question whether the appellant is a trans - CRPs 310 & 311 of 2018 2 provincial establishment for purposes of the federal law or whether it comes within the ambit of the provincial law, the appel lant falls outside the purview of both the IRA, 2012 and the SIRA, 2013, resultantly, no trade union can be registered within the appellant.

[5] In this regard it is to be noted that the learned High Court has considered this question in detail and has held th at the federal law was applicable to Shaheen Airport Services as the same was operative in more than one province and that Shaheen Airport Services did not qualify as a charitable organization in view of the activities that were entailed in the operation of its business .

[6] We are in agreement with the findings of the learned High Court. ” 2. Mr. Khalid Anwar learned Sr. ASC for the review -petitioner contends that the applicability of the Industrial Relations Act, 2012 (‘IRA 2012 ’) and the Sindh Industrial Re lations Act , 2013 (‘SIRA 2013 ’) to the petitioner was assumed on the ground that the High Court has considered this question in detail and, therefore, in the judgment under review it was maintained that the Federal law was applicable to the petitioner Shah een Airport Services as the petitioner was operative in more than one province and that it did not qualify as charitable organization in view of the activities that were entailed in the operation of its business.

[7] Per counsel such findings were per incuriam as IRA 2012 as well as SIRA 2013 expressly exclude its application to all business, trade, manufacture, calling, service, including fishing, mining, agriculture, extraction, exploration, processing, print and electronic media, employment or occupation of producing goods or services for sale.

[8] In order to support his contention, counsel has referred to the provisions of Section 2(xvii) of the IRA 2012 and 2(xvi) of SIRA 2013. It was next contended that the findings of the High Court in para 15 of its judgmen t that charity or no charity, it is the activity of the establishment that determines whether it fall s within the ambit of industry or not and the answer to this question posed lies in the definition of word industry as given in Se ction 2(xiv ) of the Indus trial Relations Ordinance, 1969, are CRPs 310 & 311 of 2018 3 erroneous and are based on the assumption that after the repeal of IRO 2008 through sunset clause on 30.4.2010 and before the promulgation of SIRA 2013, the Industrial Relations Ordinance 1969 stood revive.

[9] Again such f indings are per incuriam and against the law laid down by this Court in the case of Air League of PIAC Employees through President vs. Federation of Pakistan M/O Labour and Manpower Division Islamabad and others (2011 SCMR 1254) wherein it was clearly held that IRA 2012 would be applicable retrospectively with effect from 1.5.2010 when the IRO 2008 ceased to exist.

[10] It was, therefore, contended that dislodging the status of review petitioner as charitable institution by examining its activities was not permi ssible as envisaged in Sections 2(xvii) of IRA 2012 and 2(xvi) of SIRA 2013 and, therefore, the findings of the High Court to that extent were per incuriam and consequently the adoption of this Court of such findings in para 22 calls for review. 3.

[11] On th e other hand, it was contended that the very status of the review petitioner as a charitable institution was questioned and there are concurrent findings which assert that the petitioner is not a charitable institution. It was contended that if the charact er of the review petitioner as charitable institution is assumed, then there is no denial that the applicability of industrial relations laws would be barred as provided in IRA 2012 and SIRA 2013 as pleaded. 4.

[12] It is evident from the record that the clai m of the review petitioner as being a charitable institution through out was declined and therefore, was held to be amenable to relevant labour laws and ultimately the review petitioner filed the referred petition inter alia, seeking a declaration regardin g its status as a charitable institution and the High Court after hearing the parties, again refused to give such declaration by holding: “… though Shaheen Foundation may be, and it appears is a charitable institution but that cannot be said about the CRPs 310 & 311 of 2018 4 petitioner’s establishment i.e.

[13] SAPS. SAPS only exists for making profit. The fact that it yields its profit to Shaheen Foundation which in turn uses it for charitable purposes could not make SAPS a charitable organization. Doing so would tantamount to making , in the words of Justice Krishna Iyer “Good Samaritans” into “clever industrialists”.

[14] And ultimately this Court in para 22 upheld such finding that the review petitioner is not a charitable institution. Once such finding has come to record, th e review petitioner cannot claim the benefit of Section 2(xvii) of IRA 2012 or of 2(xvi) of SIRA 2013 in order to claim im munity. These review petitions consequently fail and are, therefore, dismissed.

[15] CRP No. 217 of 2018: Due to paucity of time, hearing of thi s review petition is adjourned. Judge Judge Islamabad, the 7th December, 2020 A. Rehman Judge Not Approved for Reporting.
