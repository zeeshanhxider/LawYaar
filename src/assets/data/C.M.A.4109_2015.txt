No.1 first thing in the morning, Mr. Aamir Rehman, learned Addl. AGP stated that there is a meeting in progress on this matter and if the case can be taken up after 12:00 noon, he will be able to place complete information b efore the Court.

[4] At 11:15 a.m. , we have exhausted the cause list. In these circumstances, let the hearing of t his matter continue in Chambers at 12:00 noon. In Chambers at 12:00 noon 2. The learned Attorney General for Pakistan is also now present. He sta tes that the matter in the Senate has passed the Committee Stage on 30.6.2015.

[5] The proposed legislation has now been placed in the current session of the Senate on 6th July, 2015 and there is a reasonable expectation that the Senate will take a decision on the matter during the current week. 3. The reason for our concern in this matter is that the citizens of the Islamabad Capital Territory s till appear to be waiting Constn.

[6] P. No.77 -2010 etc ICT elections - 3 - 3 for Local Government Elections. The last such elections were held in the Islamabad Capita l Territory in 1992 and already a period of 23 years has elapsed since then. The urgency in the matter and the need to provide elected Local Governments at the gr ass-roots level, at the earliest, cannot be gainsaid , particularly in view of the fact that Local Government Elections have already been held in Balochistan, KPK and in the Cantonment Boards while such election in Si ndh and Punjab are scheduled for mid -September. 4.

[7] Needless to say , in view of the fact that the expected legislation is not as yet in place, the Election Commission of Pakistan may notify a revised schedule f or the said elections if this becomes necessary on account of delays in Parliament. We may note that the National Assembly passed the Local Government Bill on 26.3.2015 and since then it is pending with the Senate. 5.

[8] To come up on 03.8.2015 when we may consider the possibility of Local Government Elections under previously existing legislation, so that the citizens of ICT are not discriminated against and receive their right t o elect their local bodies. Judge Judge Islamabad, the Judge 08.07.2015 Safdar/*
