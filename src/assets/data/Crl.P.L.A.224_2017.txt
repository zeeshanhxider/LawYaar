[4] Incident was reported at 3:00 a.m. after mid night whereas autopsy was conducted at 9:00 a.m. Delay in recourse to law as well as autopsy is pressed into service to argue that the witnesses were staged managed as the Criminal Petition No. 224 of 201 7 2 incident went un -witnessed ; to substantiate further, it is next argued that it was for this reason that the dead body was shifted from the alleged venue wherefrom no casing was recovered despite allegation of multiple fire shots as confirme d by the autopsy report , rendering recovery of weapon as inconsequential as considered by the learned High Court itself.

[5] Elimination of co-accused in a police ‘ encounter ’ has been pointed out to suggest that all was not well with the prosecution ; non- appearance of the Investigating Officer without any valid cause, according to the learned counsel, cause serious prejudice to the petitioner in his quest to vindicate his position, circumstances that escaped notice downstairs .
