ORDER Qazi Muhammad Amin Ahmed, J. - Aftab Alam, , left home at about 7:00 p.m .; his wife , as stated by him , expected her to return shortly thereafter , however, upon failure to return, became suspicious and informed her brother -in-law at 2:00 a.m. ; his mobile handset did not respond multiple attempts .

Criminal Petition No.500 of 2020 is converted into appeal and allowed; petitioner/appellant shall be released on his furnishing bond s in the sum of Rs.500,000/ - with two sureties each in the like amount to the satisfaction of the learned trial Court /duty Judge .
