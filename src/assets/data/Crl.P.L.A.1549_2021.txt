[2] Punjab For Respondent No.2 : In person Date of Hearing 26.01.2022. ORDER Qazi Muhammad Amin Ahmed, J. - Apprehending arrest , Rashid Imran, petitioner herein, after failure before the High Court, seeks bail in anticipation thereto ; he along with co - accused was intercepted by a Veterinary Officer on 23.6.2021 at 9:00 p.m. with 500 k.g. beef and 60 k.g. mutton on a meatless day.

[3] Upon inspection, the complainant found the confiscated stuff cold on t ouch, dark reddish in texture emitting bad smell and as such manifestly unfit for human consumption ; it carried fake stamps as deceit to suggest ante mortem slaughter . Upon a complaint, the police registered a criminal case , subsequent whereto , the impound ed meat was destroyed with magisterial intervention . 2.

[4] Heard. Record perused. 3. An inordinate stress laid by the learned counsel on the vires of exercise undertaken by the Veterinary Officer Gojra, notwithstanding, the seizure of substandard meat , grievously Criminal Petition No. 1549 of 2021 injurious for human consumption , on a meatless day i.e. Wednesday is established through the inventories of even date .

[5] Association of a Magistrate further lends credence to the procedure adopted. Quantity of confiscation is too considerable to be manipulated to set up a fake case , nor there appear s any earthly reason for the complainant, a State functionary tasked with the responsibility of ensuring hygienic livestock supplies to the public , to proceed against the petitioner with motives, oblique o r sinister , a sine qua non to suspend the mechanics of criminal law that mandatorily requires arrest in cognizable cases , scheduled as non -bailable .
