[1] ORDER Iftikhar Muhammad Chaudhry, CJ.— Instant case was initiated by exercising suo moto jurisdiction conferred upon this Court under Article 184(3) of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan, on a letter sent by members of Sikh community stating therein that Mr. Asif Akhtar Hashmi, Chairman Evacuee Trust Property Board had been selling the evacuee property especially a ttached to their worship places.

[2] Copies of the news items published in daily “Jang” Rawalpindi, “The News” Islamabad dated 21.04.2010 and the Herald (March Edition) reporting the irregularities being committed by the Evacuee Trust Property Board (ETPB) were also attached with the letter. Initially , the matter was registered as HRC No.28464 -K/2010 and report was called from Chief Secretary , Government of Punjab on the matter mentioned in the said letter .

[3] The report was received from the Secretary , Ministry of Minorities, Government of Pakistan, Islamabad stating therein “that the allegation in the application have already been probed into by Public Accounts Committee, special Public Accounts Committee, Prime Minister, Inspection Commission and Special Audit.

[4] The allegations are nothing but to spoil the name of the department as well as the image of Pakistan . Furthermore, the matter in issue was also challenged in the Ho nourable Lahore High Court wherein it was dismissed”. On 16.04.2011, t he matter was placed before one of us ( Chief Justice of Pakistan ) in Chambers for necessary orders , thus an order to the following effect was passed: - “Put up in court as petition under Article 184(3) of the Constitution.

[5] Notice to the applicant and Chairman, Evacuee Trust Board of Pakistan be issued… ” SMC  etc. 3 Resultantly, t he matter was registered as SMC No.  and fixed before th e Court. 2. It is to be mentioned that Asif Akhtar Hashm i, former Chairman ETPB appeared in person on 7.5.2013 but on the next date of hearing i.e. 24.05.2013 his counsel appeared and when his attendance was required to be procured by passing a specific order, he did not appear on 7.06.2013.

[6] He engaged Mr. Hami d Khan, learned Sr. ASC to appear on his behalf, however, despite issuance of directions he failed to appear in person before the Court. Inasmuch as, his counsel submitted before the Court that the order of this Court, had been communicated to him. At one stage it was pointed out by his counsel that he could not manage to come back to Pakistan as he had deposited his passport in Dubai with the Saudi Embassy for performing Umra and sought adjournment enabling the latter to appear in Court.

[7] At his request, ca se was adjourned on different dates and ultimately on 14.06.2013 learned counsel stated that this Court accommodated him twice by adjourning the case with the observations to produce him but despite all his efforts he could not succeed, therefore, in princ iple it would not be fair for him to make any further request to the Court in this regard, hence, he would be allowed to withdraw from appearing before this Court on his behalf in this case.

[8] The request was allowed and at the same time DG, FIA was directed to effect service of the notice upon him. In the meantime, FIA submitted a report stating therein that Syed Asif Akhtar Hashmi was still abroad and the matter had also been referred to Interpol for the service of the notice upon him. Interpol authority in Pakistan, in reply, informed that he has SMC  etc. 4 departed from UAE to UK on 14.06.2013, therefore, the matter was referred to Interpol UK and reply is awaited. 3.

Option -III ETPB may ex change its aforesaid land with DHA land in mauza Halloki (84 acres, 4 kanals and 10 marlas) adjacent to Khayaban -e-Amin and Doctor’s Colony, Kahna Road/ Defence Road, Lahore. 4.

[11] In the said meeting, t he Chairman sought guidance of the Board for proceeding further with reference to the above proposal and he also appris ed the Board about the estimated cost of land prevailing in market of ETPB and DHA. General practice of DHA , regarding allotment of two developed residential plots of one kanal each in lieu of SMC  etc. 5 one acre land , was also discussed.

[12] The Board, after due deliberations and keeping in view the existing and future potential of the DHA land situated in Mauza Halloki , rejected Option -III. Moreover, after discussing pros and cons of the remaining two options, the Board considered Option -II as more workable due to increase in the cost of developed plots.

[13] However, the Board desired that instead of consenting to two developed plots measuring one kanal in return to land measuring one acre to be handed over to DHA (i.e. 25% of land), at least 33% land of developed plots to be claimed. It was further suggested that i n addition to residential plots, commercial plots situated on the main roads/nearest to main roads preferably to be claimed. 5.

[14] Subsequent thereto , the ETPB vide letter dated 10.07.2007 issued by Deputy Secretary (P), informed the DHA, Lahore as regards approval of Option -II by the Board .

SMC  etc. 6 7. In response to the above mentioned letter, the DHA sent a letter dated 20.07.2007 to the Chairman, ETPB which reads as under: - “Subject: Acquisition of Evacuee Trust Land Please refer to ETPB letter No.

Similarly a ration in line with the international standards is maintained in residential area vs . commer cial area. Being a welfare organization , DHA acquires the land and develops it for allotment to the landowners (who contribute the land) and a portion of it for armed forces personnel for whom the society is primarily functioning.

[20] In this case under consid eration , total number of comme rcial plots being carved out is 194. it is submitted that as per SMC  etc. 7 10% formula DHA is not left with a single plot, therefore, the matter may be reconsidered and an equitable distribution be agreed upon to facilitate early resolu tion of the issue.

[62] Moreover, the report concluded that “without considering the earlier recommendations of the Board, i.e. 33% exempted developed plots as per offer of DHA dated 20.07.2007 and without determining the terms and conditions, the haphazard approval granted by the Ministry of Minorities Affairs of 25% exempted residential plots/files instead of 33% also shows personal vested interests of DHA Lahore, ETPB and concerned Ministry especially payment o f huge amount of Rs.657.77 million approx imately to unauth orized persons and thereby caused loss to ETPB ”. 27.

[63] It was also noted in the said report that , though refunded to ETPB after one and half month , the re gistration fee amounting to Rs.39 million was paid by ETPB instead of DHA Lahore , being the purchaser, and that “this fact also creates doubts of personal vested interests of ETP Board and DHA Lahore”.

[64] The report assesses the total loss caused by the DHA at Rs.1934.77 million . 28. On behalf of DHA, Lahore there is no denial of the transaction, however, an explanation has been offered that as per agreement DHA would acquire possession of the land at its o wn expense and cost, where said portion of the land was not in possession of ETPB and against the deal of 151.25 acres of land it could only get SMC  etc. 20 the title of land measuring 843K -15M by different instrument, deeds, etc.

[65] According to DHA, the consideration o f the said land was in the shape of exemption of plot files. 29. As far as balance of 288K -18M is concerned, both the DHA and ETPB after deliberation agreed as under: - a. Any land belonging to Gurdwara shall not be purchased and consequently land measurin g 203K -13M of Dera Bebe Naniki Gurdwara was returned back to ETPB by DHA in May 2010.

[66] It is pertinent to mention that DHA had made a payment of Rs.18.800 Million to purchase possession of said land. ETPB has assured DHA to return this amount and the matter is being finalized. b. ETPB shall transfer 85K -5M of land situated in Mauza Lidhar (31K -07M) and Mauza Mota Sindh Wala (53K -5M) at the earliest.

[67] It has further been explained that in pursuance of above arrangements ETPB was allocated following files in Ph ase-VI of DHA in consideration of the land acquired/transferred: - a. 140x 1 Kanal plot files b. 31x 10 Marla plot files c. 61x Marla plot files d. 10x 4 Marla Commercial plot files It may be noted that in the report submitted by DHA, neither any agreement with ETPB has been brought on record to accept the liability of the payment s of the development charges nor there is any acceptable do cument to substantiate that Rs. 18.800 million has been spent by DHA for taking over the possession of the property.

[68] Except that ETPB paid Rs.657.7 7 million approximately to Nazir Hussain (late), Amer Saleh Abbasi, Shah Jehan, Kamran Baig and Imran Ali SMC  etc. 21 Bhatti, without any plausible justification. Despite efforts, no justification was offered by the Secretary DHA , Lahore in this behalf. 30. From the material available on record one can, prima facie , conclude that without considering the earlier recommendations of the Board i.e. exemption of 33% of plots as per offer of DHA dated 20.07.2007, and without determining the terms & conditions by the Federal Government through Ministry of Minorities Affairs, agreed for accepting 25% exempted residential plots/files instead of 33%.

[69] Essentially, for such reasons colossal loss has been suffered by ETPB. 31. A comparative analysis of t he loss incurred to the ETPB for entering into the deal is reproduced hereinbelow as per report of FIA dated 24.07.2013 : Sr.No. Head/Description Loss caused to the ETPB Plot Nos. Approx per plot price (Rs.) Total Loss (Rs) 1.

[70] Reeducation from 33% exemp tion developed to 25% exemption plot files only 108 9 million 972 millions 2. Expenditures being claimed by DHA from ETPB for vacation of Dear Chahal Land - - 18 millions 3. Developmental charges be claimed by DHA against exemption allotted plot files to ETPB @ 25 % - - 287 million 4.

[71] Compensation paid by DHA to unauthorized persons instead of ETPB 59 9 millions 126.77+ 531=657.77 Million Total 1934.77 millions SMC  etc. 22 Thus, the deal suffered from corruption and corrupt practices and was in violation of rules and regulations. 32. Learned counsel for DHA Mr. Asif Hafeez, however, has attempted to persuade us that the deal between DHA and ETPB is transparent as huge amount has to be spent by DHA for getting possession of the land from occupants and it so hampered on account of delay in concluding the deal on the part of ETPB, therefore, ETPB in its 272nd meeting held on 16.04.2009 accepted revised offer of DHA for exemption of 25% residential plot instead of 33% which was duly approved by the Ministry, as such, no illegality or irregularity has been committed by DHA. 33.

[72] Learned counsel for DHA, attempted to justify the delay, as it is evident from his arguments noted hereinabove , but without producing any document or material to substantiate its plea on both counts i.e. delay by ETP Board and spending of huge amount by DHA for taking over possession from occupants of the land under question . 34.

[73] It has been noticed that from time to time the Federal Government has constituted the Board. Whereas, under s ub-section (5) of section 3 of the Act, 1975 three years tenure of the Members has been prescribed and before the expiry of the same, a Member would not be changed unless he earlier resigns from his office under sub-section (6) or is removed under sub -section (7) of section 3 ibid.

[74] The only inference is that the purpose of fixation of the tenure is to ensure consistency in the policies of the ETP Board for the purpose of achieving the objects for which the Act, 1975 has been SMC  etc. 23 promulgated. Contrary to it, as far as Chairman of the Board is concerned, he is required to hold the office during the pleasure of the Federal Government. 35.

[75] In the instant case, we have noticed that during 263rd meeting of ETP Board held on 23.07.2007 a decision was taken to accept option No.2 offered by DHA, namely, ETPB land be handed over to DHA for development and in exchange the developed plots as per laid down procedure, would be given to ETPB. It was also decided that DHA would handover 33% developed plots to ETPB, besides 10% of the commercial plots to be offered to ETPB on the rates as for members of the DHA and this offer was also accepted by DHA on 20.07.2007, but before its final approval, the ETP Board was reconstituted on 14.11.2007.

[76] Names of the newly appointed memb ers have also been mentioned hereinabove. As per the requirement of law, these non -official members had to perform their functions for a period of three years i.e. upto 13.11.2010. In the meanwhile, former Chairman ETPB, Mr. Asif Akhtar Hashmi was appointe d on 7.12.2008, before expiry of the tenures of the members appointed on 14.11.2007 and the Board was again re -constituted on 10.04.2009.

[77] The issue of getting developed residential and commercial plots, decision in respect whereof had already taken place i n 263rd meeting dated 23.07.2007, was again placed before the Board for discussion and decision. Surprisingly, instead of accepting the earlier better terms and conditions, fresh proposal was introduced after taking over of office by the newly appointed Ch airman and DHA had revised its offer.

[78] Inasmuch as , the Federal Government without negotiation or determining viable terms and conditions gave approval on 16.04.2009 . SMC  etc. 24 36. It would be appropriate to mention that from very beginning the ETPB had been insist ing that DHA should commit in writing, inter alia , that taking over of the possession of the Evacuee Trust land situated in Mauza Lidhar, Mauza Mota Singh Wala and Mauza Dera Chahal from its lessees will be sole responsibility of DHA and expenditures so in curred shall not be claimed from ETPB.

[79] Reference in this behalf may be made to the meeting of ETP Board dated 22.04.2008, relevant contents wherefrom are reproduced hereinbelow: - “(vii) Deputy Secretary (Property), ETP Board, Lahore will prepare a draft le tter to be sent to be sent to the DHA authorities indicating the points on which their confirmation is required particularly about the following: - (a) Taking over of possession of Evacuee Trust land situated in mauzas Lidhar, Mota Singwala and Dera Chahal from its lessess will be sole responsibility of DHa and expenditure so incurred shall not be claimed from ETPB. (b) Phase and sector, where residential and commercial plots will be allotted by DHA to ETPB (in lieu of Evacuee Trust land situated in after -mentioned mauzas). (c) All the plots to be allotted will be at one place in a compact block/form.

[80] In case it is not possible then what arrangement will be made by DHa. (d) Charges, if any, required to be paid by ETPB in respect of residential plots to be allotted. (e) Total cos t to be charged in respect of each commercial plot to be allotted.” 37. In continuation of above letter, on 7.06.2008 the earlier stand taken by ETPB was reiterated; however, after appointment of former Chairman, Mr.

[81] Asif Akhtar Hashmi, on 18.02.2009 D HA intimated that 33% exemption ratio besides, 100 x commercial plots were agreed to by it but progress on acquisition of the land was held SMC  etc. 25 up due to non -acceptance of handing over of clear possession of land by ETPB. It was further emphasized in this very letter that “either land be transferred with clear possession to DHA against 33% exemption or 25% exemption without possession may pleased be agreed to”.

[82] Although, as it has been explained earlier, before appointment of the former Chairman, Mr. Asif Akhta r Hashmi, the DHA has agreed to grant 33% exemption of plots instead of 25% with 100 x commercial plots on the rates available for the members of DHA, but in such a situation when we asked the learned counsel for DHA to substantiate with documents the amou nt which has been spent by the DHA for taking over the possession, he could not do so.

[83] Therefore, it is held that in the 272nd meeting dated 16.04.2009 the decision was changed by the ETP Board intentionally, on account of which a huge loss has been caused as it has been analyzed in the FIA reports, referred to hereinabove. Such decision also adversely reflects the mala fide in the reconstitution of the Board on 10.04.2009 before expiry of three years’ tenure of the members, who were appointed on 14.11.2009 ; therefore, for such reasons the Board should have not approved acceptance of formula of 25% exemption as it was against the interest of charitable institutions. 38.

[84] There is no denial of the fact that ETPB had powers to dispose of the properties but i t must be in accordance with the law namely section 4(2) of the Act, 1975 as it has been held in the case of Pervaiz Oliver v. St. Gabrial School (PLD 1999 SC 26), relevant para therefrom is reproduced hereinbelow: - “It is a known fact that the above porti on of the property is extremely valuable . ………… It is SMC  etc. 26 anybody's guess as to what may have transpired in an underhand manner between the concerned individuals, particularly, Said Muhammad and the Evacuee Trust functionaries.

[85] Some of the staff has already bee n identified in this order. The Assistant Administrators, holding office from time to time in the Quetta region and the Administrator, who passed the orders dated 6 -3-1996 and 31 -12-1996, would now come to be identified and located. All of these shall be s ubjected to departmental proceedings, as reflected below.

[86] Pausing here, we consider it our bounden duty to observe that many of those in the administration, politicians and bureaucrats alike, virtually consider public property as their own to be' appropria ted or allocated at their whims or fancies. Nothing is further removed from legal realities. No public property, big or small, tangible or intangible. can be disposed of except in accordance with law.

[87] Those who transgress. Expose themselves to the severest of penalties under law, the cardinal principle being. the higher the functionary, the higher the responsibility and, for that reason. the, stricter the punishment. ” Reference may also be made to the case of Action regarding joint venture agreement between CDA and Multi -Professional Cooperative Housing Society (PLD 2011 SC 619), relevant para therefrom is reproduced hereinbelow: - “28. … … It is to be seen whether the CDA Board could have, in all fairness, agreed to terms and conditions, which were totally different from those mentioned in the advertisement and render the transaction bereft of the essential attributes of transparency and fairplay.

[88] The Governmental bodies are invested with powers to dispense and regulate special services by means of leases, l icences, SMC  etc. 27 contracts, quotas, etc., where they are expected to act fairly, justly and in a transparent manner and such powers cannot be exercised in an arbitrary or irrational manner.

[89] Transparency lies at the heart of every transaction entered into by, or on behalf of, a public body. To ensure transparency and fairness in contracts, inviting of open bids is a prerequisite. The reservations or restrictions, if any, in that behalf should not be arbitrary and must be justifiable on the basis of some policy or va lid principles, which by themselves are reasonable and not discriminatory. ” 39.

[90] Now turning towards another deal entered upon by ETPB in 2009 by invest ing Rs.986.00 million in the project of “Elysium Ranches DHA, Islamabad and M/s HLC ”, it is to be noted that in pursuance whereof following proposals for the investment was made: - “Proposal for EVACUEE Properties Investment Elysium Holding Pakistan Limited has given us the mandate for the procurement of land and sale of Project File (Allotment Certificates ) for the above mentioned project (copies of JV agreement between DHA Islamabad and Elysium Holding Pakistan Limited and MOU between Highland Living Concept & Elysium Holding Pakistan Limited is attached for reference.) We would like EVACUEE to join us as an institutional investor of Project Files (Allotment Certificates), it may be mentioned that a number of other prominent institutional investors have already joined hands to profit from this lacerative investment at this stage of the project.

[91] The mode of EVACUEE investment will be as fol lows: - SMC  etc. 28  Once each tranche s of 32 kanals are procured 8 kanals of the project file (Allotment Certificate) will be PKR 600,000/ - i.e. 600,000 x32=PKR 19,200,000/ -  Government Levies per kanal i.e. CT+Mutation Charges will be 7.2% of Government Declared Price Rs.120,000/ - i.e. 120,000 X 7.2%=8640 X 32=PKR 276,480/ -  Out of Pocket Expenses will be PKR 10,000 X 32= PKR 320,000  Total investment for each project file (Allotment Certificate) will be PKR 19,796,480/ -  Launch or reserve d price with Buy Back guarantee by the sponsors of project will be PKR 30,000,000/ - per project file / property with a total net profit of PKR 10,203,520/ - which amounts to 34%, higher than any other investment opportunity in the market with negligible ris k due to Buy Back Guarantee from sponsors.

[92] This ROI can be increased manifold if the files are sold and the amount reinvented The above price is base d on an institutional buying of at least 50 Project Files (Allotment Certificates) / Properties.  Processin g period of conversion of land into project files after al legal due diligence will be 7 working days.

[93] Furthermore issuance of project files (Allotment Certificates) will be 6 Working days from the date of mutation.” 40. The ETP Board in its 272nd meetin g held on 16.04.2009 considered the said proposal as additional agenda item 5 and decided as under: - PROPOSAL FROM HIGHLAND LIVING CONCEPT FOR INVESTMENT/JOINT VENTURE IN ELYSIUM RANCHES DHA, ISLAMABAD Discussion/Decision Action by The Board unanimously approved the proposal of Highland Living Concept for investment/joint venture with ETP Board in Elysium Ranches DHA, Islamabad subject to the condition that DHA, Islamabad will give guarantee for the 34% of CAA SMC  etc. 29 profit on the investment made by the ETP Board. 41.

[94] It is important to note that DHA Islamabad/Rawalpindi submitted a report before the Court on 27.04.2013 in which it was stated that “DHA Islamabad/Rawalpindi has not sold any property to ETPB through Mr. Asif Hashmi, nor Mr. Asif Hashmi has appr oached DHA Islamabad/Rawalpindi for any deal”. Further, DHA Islamabad/Rawalpindi vide another report filed before the Court on 24.05.2013 submitted that Elysium Holdings Pakistan Ltd. (EHPL), previously, Elysium Pakistan Ltd. is a public limited company fo rmed for acquiring by purchase or otherwise land and to develop the same in plots and sell or establish housing est ates, construct houses, buildings etc. and to provide amenities and utility services to the schemes.

[95] The names of the directors of EHPL , at t he time of signing of the agreement with DHA Islamabad/ Rawalpindi are also provided in the report, which are as under: - (a) At the time of signing of the Agreement : (1) Waseem Aslam (Director/CEO) (2) Ms. Ambreen Naz (3) Muhammad Usman Yousaf (b) Present : (1) Muhammad Hamma d Arshad (Director/CEO) (2) Muhammad Murad Arshad (3) Chaudhary Ahmed Aziz 42.

[96] With regard to the investment of ETPB in the project of Elysium Ranches DHA, Islamabad , it is further to be noted that on 10.07.2008 M/s Elysium Holding Pakistan Ltd. (EHPL) signed joi nt venture agreement with DHA for purchase of land in Zone -IV, SMC  etc. 30 Islamabad, for development of Project and marketing/selling of the same.

[97] It seems that before implementation of the agreement another idea of investment was introduced by M/s Highland Living Co ncept (HLC) Lahore, which was approved in the ETP Board’s meeting dated 16.04.2009 as well as by the Investment Advisory Committee of ETPB. In the meanwhile, respondent Mr. Asif Akhtar Hashmi had been appointed as Chairman, ETPB on 07.12.2008.

[98] In continuat ion of this development/project, on 08.7.2009 ETPB signed tri -partite agreement with M/s EHP and M/s HLC, according to which ETPB was to be provided with 50 project files/allotment certificates (each of 8 -kanals plot-value of each plot mentioned in the pro posal was Rs.19.72 million) of DHA as security, which were to be purchased by EHP after 30 months @ Rs.30.00 million each.

[99] Accordingly, from July to October, 2009 ETPB transferred an amount of Rs.986.00 million in the bank account of M/s HLC, out of which an amount of Rs.608.00 million was transferred to M/s EHP. 43. It was also stated in the above mentioned report that EHPL had approached DHA Islamabad representing to have rights in the lands situated in different mauzas of Islamabad and DHA agreed to th e said proposal , consequent to which an agreement was executed between EHPL and DHA Islamabad on 10.07.2008 whereby EHP was obliged to transfer land measuring approx 30,000 kanals.

[100] EHP however could not fulfill its commitment to provide “initial land” with in the specified time period. It was reiterated that ETPB or Mr. Asif Hashmi, ex-Chairman ETPB has neither approached DHA for any investment or sale/verification of any allotment certificates nor any funds from any such sale have been received by DHA Islam abad.

[101] SMC  etc. 31 44. It is also pertinent to note in this regard that Finance Division (Budget Wing), Government of Pakistan vide Office Memorandum dated 02.07.2003 captioned “Deposit of Working Balances and Investment of Surplus Funds Belonging to Public Sector Enterprises and Local/Autonomous Bodies under Federal Government” issued consolidated instructions wherein it was mentioned that “before making any investment under this policy, it would be necessary for public sector entities to set up in -house professional treasury management functions.

[102] Specifically, they would need to have an investment Committee (IC) with defined investment approval authority. Transactions above the approval authority of the IC will be subject to approval of the Board of Directors or an e quivalent forum. The IC should be assisted by an Investment Management Unit employing qualified staff with at least 3 -5 years of experience of managing investment in debt/equity instruments.

[103] However, it will be necessary for public sector enterprises to us e the service of professional fund mangers approved by SCEP”. 45. It must be highlighted that no permission was obtained for investment in DHA Islamabad under section 4(2)(c) and (m) of the Evacuee Trust Properties (Management and Disposal) Act, 1975 wh ich provides that the function of the board shall be “to buy out of surplus income if any, or by, taking loan from any statutory corporation, with the approval of the Federal Government any other property which may be considered to be beneficial for promot ing the objects of this Act or any scheme”; and “to invest money, with the prior approval of the Federal Government, for any other social welfare or charitable SMC  etc. 32 purpose”.

[104] Therefore, the law was violated by making payments to Highland Living Concepts. 46. It may not be out of context to note here that one Sharjeel Shah Muhammad , CEO represent ed to HLC whereas Hammad Arshad, CEO represented to EHP. However, i t is reported by FIA that according to record maintained by Securities and Exchange Commission of Pakistan (SECP) , M/s Kamran Kiani, Waseem Aslam and Aftab Zahoor were founding Directors of M/s EHP, whereas , according to information revealed to FIA by DHA , Waseem Aslam, Am breen Naz and Muhammad Usman Yousaf were the Directors at the time of joint venture agreement dated 10.07.2008.

[105] Subsequent thereto , it was further revealed by SECP that M/s Kamran Kiani and Aftab Zahoor resigned on 13.06.2007 and 29.01.2008 , respectively , before signing of the joint venture agreement noted hereinbefore. As far as Ambreen Naz is concerned, she also resigned from her position on 05.09.2008. Presently, Hamad Arshad is CEO of the Company because Waseem Aslam, who was holding the charge prior to him, had resigned on 04.01.2012. 47.

[106] Perusal of record/report filed by FIA revea ls that for making this investment no approval of the Federal Government under section 4(2)(c) of the Evacuee Trust Propert ies (Management and Disposal ) Act, 1975 was available on record, as such, FIA had to register a case because due to non-availability of relevant files the FIA could not conduct inquiry as per direction of this Court issued vide order dated 7.5.2013; therefore, against Faizan Shams, former Investment Management Officer of ETPB , a case was registered vide SMC  etc. 33 FIR No.596 dated 9.05.2013 under section 409 PPC .

[107] As far as DHA, Islamabad is concerned, it has also not denied entering into agreement dated 10.07.2008 with EHP , in pursuance whereof EHP was under obligation to transfer land measuring approximately 30,000 kanal s in favour of DHA, Islamab ad and to plain, develop, market and sell the proposed mixed used project on the said land , etc.

[108] However, ETPB through its Chairman Asif Akhtar Hashmi has never approached DHA, Islamabad for investment or sale , etc. It is to be noted that Zone -IV of Islama bad is located within the domain of CDA and according to its record , in this Zone no project with name of ‘Elysium Ranches, DHA, Islamabad ’ has ever been introduced by joint venture of DHA and EHP, therefore, the conclusion is that without verifying and ex amining the existence of ‘Elysium Ranches DHA, Islamabad ’, ETPB made the investment and allowing the benefit of this investment to another party i.e.

[109] M/s HLC , as a tri -partite agreement was executed. Interestingly, M/s HLC received Rs.986.00 million from E TPB, out of which , statedly, it transferred Rs.608.00 million and balance of Rs.378.00 million is still lying with it. Reference is also necessary at this stage to the stand taken by Hamad Arshad , CEO EHP before this Court 14.06.2013, who stated that witho ut prejudice to his constitutional and legal rights , he is deposit ing the amount of Rs.986.00 million towards full refund of the investment made by the ETPB. although directions were made on 07.06.2013 to both of them i.e.

[110] Sharjeel Shah Muhammad , CEO HLC and Hamad Arshad CEO of EHP. He also prayed that as per tripartite agreement, ETPB made investment on the basis of 50 files, which were provided to ETPB , SMC  etc. 34 therefore, it would be just, fair and equitable that files be transferred back to him as he ha d alread y made the payment. 48.

[111] Khwaja M. Farooq, Sr. ASC appearing on behalf Sharjeel Shah Muhammad, CEO Highland Living Concepts submitted that a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was executed between EHPL and HLC on 07.11.2008 whereby HLC confirmed to purchas e a minimum of 5000 kanals land at its sole cost and expense located in Zone-IV of Islamabad for the purpose of proposed project named “DHAI’s Elysium Ranches Project” on behalf of the EHPL and that all such lands shall be mutated by the HLC in favor of DH A.

[112] It was asserted that HLC acting in the capacity of a property dealer/service had received its commission of 2% while the entire amount was then transferred to Elysium. 49. In view of the material collected during hearing of the petition through FIA, re ference of which has been made hereiabove, arguments so advanced by the learned counsel on behalf of Sharjeel Shah Muhammad, CEO of HLC is not acceptable because he has received Rs.986.00 million from ETPB out of which Rs.608.00 million was transferred in the account of EHP being maintained by its CEO Hamad Arshad and balance of Rs.3.76 million is lying with HLC.

[113] However, as per our directions dated 07.06.2013 both of them were required to deposit this amount but he (Sharjeel Shah Muhammad) has failed to co mply with the directions as a result whereof Hamad Arshad had also borne his financial burden. 50. Needless to say that ETPB’s Chairman and Members of the Board in pursuance of the decision, which was taken as an additional Agenda No.5 in 272nd meeting he ld on 16.04.2009 made investment of SMC  etc. 35 Rs.986.00 million but without settling the terms and conditions and realizing that there is absolutely no existence of ‘Elysium Ranches DHA, Islamabad ’.

[114] The recovery of principle amount has already been made under the or der of this Court both Sharjeel Shah Muhammad, CEO HLC and Hamad Arshad CEO EHP were also bound to pay mark up on Rs.986.00 million from the date of its payment and passing the order of this Court as they had benefitted from this amount without extending a ny profit to ETPB and in the same manner, Chairman ETPB and Members as well Secretary of Ministry of Minorities Affairs, who endorsed such deal which was in fact non existent is liable to be dealt with according to law. 51.

[115] Thus, we are of the considere d opinion that transaction of ETPB for making investment of Rs.986.00 million was contrary to the interest of ETPB and against the instructions of the Government as well as section 4(2) of the Act, 1975, in view of the law laid down in Pervaiz Oliver’s cas e (ibid), reference of which has already been made hereinabove. 52.

[116] In view of the above discussion, instant petition under Article 184(3) of the Constitution of Islamic Republic of Pakistan is allowed with the following declarations: - DHA Lahore: (1) Matter relating to acquisition of Evacuee Trust land situated in Mauza Lidhar, Mauza Mota Singh Wala and Mauza Dera Chahal Tehsil Cantt.

[117] Lahore by the Defence Housing Authority Lahore, vide decision dated 16.04.2009 of ETPB taken in its 272nd meeting approving the revised offer of DHA for exemption of 25% residential plots is SMC  etc. 36 unlawful, being contrary to section 4(2) of the Evacuee Trust Properties (Management & Disposal) Act, 1975, as the earlier decision taken on 23.07.2007 by ETP Board in its 263rd meeting wa s in accordance with the law as DHA in its letter has already agreed on 20.07.2007 that ETPB land would be acquired by DHA at 33% exemption of residential plots (measuring 1 -Kanal each) as a result whereof DHA had to provide 642 residential plots on acquir ing 1946 - Kanals of ETPB land, in addition to DHA’s offer of 100 x commercial plots on payment as for DHA members i.e. 16% of residential plots instead of 10%. (2) Prima facie , subject to determination by the investigation agencies, ETPB had to suffer accumulat ive loss on account of deal under review amounting to Rs.1934.77 million, analyses of which has been noted hereinabove based on report of FIA. (3) As the decision of the Board with regard to deal of ETPB and subsequent approval given by the Government vide letter No.P(3)/DSP/530/ETPB/07/LHR/3266 dated 29.04.2009 is void, and is of no legal consequences.

[118] Therefore, option is being given to DHA to accept the ETP Board’s decision taken in 263rd meeting dated 23.07.2007 and handover the developed residential and c ommercial plots, details of which have been given hereinabove, to the ETPB. Acceptance of this offer must be communicated to ETPB within 30 days after receipt hereof, failing which DHA shall SMC  etc. 37 be bound to refund the land owned by ETPB situated in Mauza Lidh ar, Mauza Mota Singh Wala and Mauza Dera Chahal etc. (4) It has also come on record that DHA has acquired more land than agreed upon, therefore, Senior Member Board of Revenue, Government of Punjab is directed to make arrangement for the demarcation of the pr operties owned by ETPB referred to hereinabove and ensure the restoration of the excess land; and on non acceptance of option noted above, total land so occupied/acquired shall be delivered back to ETPB by DHA by reversing the mutation entries and also can celling the sale deeds, executed between the parities referred to in the judgment.
