## 💡 **Prompt Design**

### **Critical Rules Added:**

```python
CRITICAL RULES:
- Extract ONLY the legal principles and findings
- DO NOT mention case names (e.g., "Ali v. Hassan") 
- DO NOT mention judges, courts, or dates
- DO NOT include citations or reference numbers
- Focus on WHAT the law says, not WHERE it comes from
- End with brief note that detailed citations are in PDF
```

### **Focus Shift:**

**From:** "Here's what the cases say..."  
**To:** "Here's what the LAW says..."

**From:** "In Case X, the court held..."  
**To:** "The legal position is..."
